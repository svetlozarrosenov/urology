2,Top 5 Reasons to See Your Urologist – For Men,Top 5 Reasons to See Your Urologist – For Men,"<p>
	Your urinary and genital tract health is important and should be monitored accordingly. Unfortunately, patients often overlook or dismiss symptoms that may hint at underlying conditions that might be serious.</p>
<p>
	I know it is easy to put off seeing the doctor, but avoiding your urologist could mean delaying or preventing treatment that may prove life saving. Knowing when to schedule an appointment with your urologist is paramount to early treatment and care.</p>
<p>
	Need more persuasion? Below are five instances that necessitate an appointment.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Abnormal PSA test</strong>: A PSA test screens for prostate cancer by measuring the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Because prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the U.S., an abnormal or elevated PSA test should receive immediate follow-up.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Hematuria</strong>: Hematuria is a fancy word for the presence of blood in urine. Hematuria can be caused by a number of potentially serious conditions including bladder cancer, kidney cancer, urinary tract infections and stones. Consult your urologist if you discover blood in your urine.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Kidney stones</strong>: A key symptom of kidney stones is severe pain in the lower stomach, side of the back, groin or testicles. Left untreated, stones can wreak havoc on the kidneys and cause permanent, lasting damage. Remember, one of the biggest risk factors for kidney stones is inadequate fluid intake. Increasing the amount of water you drink could help reduce their occurrence.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Enlarged prostate</strong>: As men age, their prostates tend to grow larger. If the prostate grows too large it puts pressure on the urethra and can obstruct urine flow. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH can cause many symptoms including an urge to urinate often, weak urine flow and pain in the lower back, pelvis or thighs.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Vasectomy</strong>: A vasectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the sealing or cutting of the vas deferens from each testicle to prevent sperm from mixing with semen. It is considered a permanent form of birth control, and therefore should not be approached lightly. Your urologist can provide expert advice on what to expect as well as perform the procedure.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	These conditions and procedures are only a few of the many reasons patients visit a urologist. If you have any concerns regarding your urinary or genital tract health, it might be time to schedule an appointment.</p>

4,Standing Firm on Value of PSA Test,"PSA testing position
","<p>
	To say we are disappointed in a decision by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to recommend against use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for cancer screening is an understatement. Data continues to confirm that early testing for prostate cancer, in particular the use of the PSA test, has contributed to the decline in death rates from prostate cancer by nearly 40 percent over the last two decades.</p>
<p>
	Oddly, the task force did not include any physician who treats prostate cancer and chose to ignore credible data from recent studies when they issued their recommendation. The Urology Group has treated thousands of patients with prostate cancer and we know for a fact that early detection is the key.</p>
<p>
	Here are some prostate cancer facts for patients and families to consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in American men, second only to lung cancer.</li>
	<li>
		One in six men will get prostate cancer at some point and nearly 30,000 men will die from the disease this year.</li>
	<li>
		One in 12,000 men under age 40 will be diagnosed.</li>
	<li>
		African American men carry the highest burden of prostate cancer in the U.S. with an incidence rate 60% higher. They are two-and-a-half times more likely to die from the disease than men of any other ethnic group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We feel so strongly that screening is key to survival that we have launched a community awareness program in the Greater Cincinnati area. For information on free prostate cancer screenings I encourage you to visit <a href=""http://www.freeprostatecincy.com"" target=""_blank"">www.freeprostatecincy.com</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to support additional research consider joining us for our annual <a href=""http://theurologygroup.dev.websprockets.com/education-and-events/great-prostate-challenge/"">Great Prostate Cancer Challenge 5K Run/Walk</a> on Saturday, September 8. You&rsquo;ll find more information in Education/Events section of our website.</p>
<p>
	My advice to all men 50 and older&mdash;or to men who are 40 and are African American or have a family history of prostate cancer&mdash;is to make a prostate exam a part of your annual checkup. We know screening works and will continue to be an advocate for the PSA test despite what a government panel believes.&nbsp;</p>

5,Vasectomy? Three things to ask yourself first,Vasectomy decision,"<p>
	The question of &quot;Am I ready for a vasectomy?&quot; is becoming more and more frequent among men these days, but the answer still requires some thought.</p>
<p>
	Not that the procedure is new. Vasectomies have been regarded as a method of birth control for roughly 70 years &ndash; since the second World War. Yet for many of those decades, the procedure was used sparingly; many men were uncomfortable with the idea of elective surgery in general and of surgery on their sexual organs in particular.</p>
<p>
	But today, vasectomies are much more mainstream &ndash; a story in <a href=""http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/healthyperspective/post/2012-03-15/vasectomy-madness-promoted-by-urologists-during-ncca-tournament/649151/1""><em>USA Today</em></a> even reported a spike in vasectomies during March Madness, as men timed the procedure so they could get several days off to sit on the couch to watch the games.</p>
<p>
	Clearly more men are becoming comfortable with the procedure as education about vasectomies is more widely available. Most notable, a vasectomy is a far less invasive operation than tubal ligation is for women.</p>
<p>
	Still, the procedure has long-term results, and there are still a lot of misconceptions. If you are considering a vasectomy, there are three key questions you should have answered:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Do I want any more children?</strong> Make no mistake, vasectomies are considered a permanent and irreversible method of birth control. And while there is a procedure, called a vasovasostomy, that might restore fertility afterward, you should never plan a vasectomy with this later option in mind. Wait.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Will it affect my sexual performance or libido?</strong> Many men fear that a vasectomy will hinder sexual performance or drive, but this is simply not the case. In a vasectomy, the two vas deferens are cut to prevent sperm from traveling from the testes to the penis. Nothing in the procedure affects physical sexual performance, and you should still experience an erection and ejaculation. In fact, the testicles continue to produce sperm, but your body absorbs the sperm.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Is sterilization immediate?</strong> No. It usually takes a few months before sterility is complete, and 15 to 20 ejaculations are required to clear viable sperm from the reproductive system. You should use birth control until your physician determines you are completely sterile.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A vasectomy is a safe, fast procedure with fewer side effects than tubal ligation. That said, there may be minor complications, including sperm granuloma (a lump caused by leaking sperm where the vas deferens is tied off) and sperm build up or congestion. But these potential side effects occur only in the first few months after the procedure.</p>
<p>
	Which is why timing also is a major consideration. Whether you want to schedule a vasectomy before March Madness or in the middle of summer, be sure to get a thorough consultation with your physician first.</p>

6,"Your PSA is Elevated, What Happens Next?","When it comes to maintaining your good health, fewer things in life promise better odds than preventive care.","<p>
	When it comes to maintaining your good health, fewer things in life promise better odds than preventive care. So what happens next if you&rsquo;ve dutifully gotten your PSA screening, only to learn that your PSA levels are elevated?</p>
<p>
	Though members of a recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force might argue that you shouldn&rsquo;t even have been tested, I believe your follow-up care remains as important as the initial testing.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s important to understand that a high PSA test doesn&rsquo;t always signal prostate problems. You might be surprised to learn that your PSA levels can fluctuate throughout the month. Because of this natural change, your doctor will likely (and really should) perform another PSA test about four to six weeks after the initial test. The time frame allows the body&rsquo;s PSA levels to normalize, resulting in a more accurate test.</p>
<p>
	If the levels are still high after the second test, your doctor might recommend a digital rectal exam that screens for structural abnormalities in the prostate. Your doctor will then read the images and consider other signs and symptoms to determine if a biopsy is necessary. Additional indicators of prostate cancer include difficulty urinating, decreased urine stream flow, blood in the urine and/or semen, swollen legs, pelvic discomfort and bone pain.</p>
<p>
	If your doctor decides a prostate biopsy is necessary, it&rsquo;s not necessarily cause for alarm. Most prostate biopsies are transrectal &mdash; a thin needle is inserted through the urethra in order to take multiple samples from the prostate glad. While I will admit that the procedure can be a bit uncomfortable, the discomfort is negligible when weighing the risks of unchecked cancer.</p>
<p>
	A high PSA doesn&#39;t always signify cancer, but following up after an elevated test is key for early detection and care. Don&#39;t gamble on your health, follow your doctor&#39;s advice and be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment.</p>

7,Botox Injections Not Just for Wrinkles – Drug Now Approved to Treat Urinary Incontinence,"Botox, the widely used wrinkle-removing injection, is now government-approved to treat urinary incontinence.","<p>
	Botox, the widely used wrinkle-removing injection<em>,</em> actually has a variety of medical uses: it&rsquo;s government-approved to treat chronic migraines, muscle problems, underarm sweating and a number of other conditions. Now add to that, urinary incontinence.</p>
<p>
	In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm269509.htm"" target=""_blank"">approved Botox</a>, or botulinum toxin, to treat incontinence in patients with neurological conditions like spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Nerve damage from these and other conditions increase the risk for urinary incontinence. Patients often need medications to relax the bladder, as well as catheters to empty the bladder.&nbsp; Current studies are evaluating the use of Botox for patients with urinary incontinence that is not due to a neurologic condition.</p>
<p>
	How does Botox treat urinary incontinence? Botox helps urinary incontinence by relaxing the bladder, thus allowing it to store more urine. In some patients with neurological conditions, over activity in the bladder leads to an inability to store urine. By injecting Botox directly into the bladder to relax it, patients gain more muscle control and less incontinence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Botox treatment involves injection of the drug into the bladder during cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a medical procedure that lets a doctor see inside the bladder. It sometimes requires general anesthesia.</p>
<p>
	The FDA looked at two clinical trials involving 691 patients with incontinence due to spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Those who received Botox had a significant reduction in weekly incontinence episodes, compared to a placebo group. The most common adverse effects were urinary tract infection and urinary retention.</p>
<p>
	Given that incontinence is difficult to manage &mdash; typically involving drugs to relax the bladder and the use of a catheter to empty it &mdash; Botox may give some patients another option. Based on clinical trials, one injection may help control incontinence for up to 10 months.</p>

8,Pelvic floor weakness: Four myths,"Awareness is sometimes 90 percent of our understanding. Yet it is that remaining 10 percent, what we don't know, that colors our perceptions.","<p>
	Awareness is sometimes 90 percent of our understanding. Yet it is that remaining 10 percent, what we don&#39;t know, that colors our perceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Consider pelvic floor weakness. Up until just a few years ago, many women never heard the term. But that does not mean the condition never existed, and thanks to medical attention and awareness campaigns, more women are seeking and getting treatment.</p>
<p>
	Pelvic floor weakness often results when the weight-bearing or stabilizing structures that keep the vagina and nearby organs in place weaken or deteriorate. Common causes include pregnancy, obesity, a hysterectomy or menopause.</p>
<p>
	These causes are pretty common, but the nature of the condition leads to many distressing misconceptions. So I decided to take on four of the biggest myths and dispel them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Pelvic floor weakness occurs only in women who have had children:</strong> All women are susceptible and, for that matter, even men have pelvic floors and can experience pelvic floor spasm or pain. But it is true that women who have had children are more likely to experience pelvic floor weakness or prolapse.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Caesarean section deliveries prevent pelvic floor weakness:</strong> This is not necessarily true, since the cause of pelvic floor weakness or prolapse is associated with the added weight and pressure of carrying a child to full term. The actual mode of delivery is not proven to be a component or contributing factor.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>There are no treatments: </strong>There are several was to treat pelvic floor weakness, both medically and holistically. Kegel exercises, for instance, may help to treat stress incontinence that results from pelvic floor weakness. If the patient suffers pelvic floor prolapse &ndash; usually a &quot;tear&quot; in the pelvic support resulting from pregnancy &ndash; surgery or a pessary device can help to remedy the condition. Also, despite alternative treatments, pelvic mesh is still used frequently across the country because of its theoretical durability.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Your organs will &ldquo;fall out&rdquo;:</strong> One of the most worrisome symptoms of prolapse is that organs may fall out through the vagina. This is not the case. For instance, in bladder prolapse (cystocele), the back wall of the bladder may drop or bulge into (or even out of) the vagina, but the bladder will not fall out completely.</li>
</ul>

9,Prostate Cancer: Treatment v. Wait-and-See,One in six American men will get prostate cancer during their lifetime.,"<p>
	One in six American men will get prostate cancer during their lifetime. Thanks to early detection and proper treatment, most of those men will not suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>
	A man who is diagnosed with prostate cancer needs to work closely with his physician to understand precisely his condition and to make decisions about the course of treatment he needs to pursue.</p>
<p>
	Physicians at The Urology Group understand how overwhelming this process can be. We work very closely with our prostate cancer patients to help them understand their individual diagnosis, the treatment options best for them, and potential risks of various treatment approaches. Patients often meet with a variety of physicians in our Group to receive different perspectives on their treatment options.</p>
<p>
	There is a wide range of treatment options for men with prostate cancer, ranging from a wait-and-see approach, to radiation therapy (external beam radiation, or radiation implants called &ldquo;seeds&rdquo;), or surgery (today surgery to remove the prostate is usually done laparoscopically with a &ldquo;robot&rdquo;). &nbsp;Determining the course of treatment involves careful evaluation of many factors, including the patient&rsquo;s age, heath, the stage and aggressiveness of the cancer and, of course, the patient&rsquo;s preference. Particular attention needs to be given to quality of life considerations important to each patient.</p>
<p>
	It is very important that men visit their physician for regular prostate cancer screenings. &nbsp;Men over the age of 50 should receive testing annually. Men in high-risk groups (African Americans or those with a family history of prostate cancer) should be screened beginning at age 45. The prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a blood test that can help indicate the presence of prostate cancer. In fact, the PSA test typically produces a tumor diagnosis six to thirteen years earlier than a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms that occur.&nbsp; Early detection &ndash; combined with a proper course of treatment agreed upon by the physician and patient &ndash; has lead to the increased survival rate we are now seeing among men with prostate cancer.</p>

10,The 'Big O' Helps Lead the Fight for ZERO,Dr. Schwartz shares his experience at the Great Prostate Cancer Challenge 5k Run/Walk.,"<p>
	<img alt=""Ribbon Cutting"" src=""/Media/303/DSC_0190.jpg""></p>
<p>
	As a physician with The Urology Group my colleagues and I get first-hand experience at the toll prostate cancer (or any cancer for that matter) takes on a patient and his family and friends. We&rsquo;re proud that the physicians in our group focus on treating both the medical and the human side of these ugly diseases.</p>
<p>
	We are passionate about fighting prostate cancer and that passion showed last Saturday, September 8, at our 6th annual Great Prostate Cancer Challenge 5k Run/Walk event. As The Urology Group&rsquo;s Chairperson for the race I must admit I wasn&rsquo;t sure the event would even go on when I woke Saturday morning to thunder and rain. However, as the rain continued to pour, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the number of people who kept on coming. Volunteers, runners, walkers, family and friends. They just kept coming. In the end, a record-breaking 874 runners and walkers registered for the event &mdash; with nearly 150 of them actually making the choice to register that morning! I couldn&rsquo;t believe the support.</p>
<p>
	We delayed the race by 15 minutes to wait for the rain to subside and then, almost by miracle, the sun began to shine. The first runner returned in just over 17 minutes and then, one-by-one hundreds of others crossed the finish line. Although we&rsquo;re still tallying the numbers we know this year&rsquo;s event brought in more money to fight prostate cancer than ever before. ZERO &ndash; The End of Prostate Cancer (<a href=""http://zerocancer.org"">http://zerocancer.org</a>) is the national nonprofit that was the benefactor of our race and 33 others like it around the country. ZERO&rsquo;s goal is to raise more than $1mm in 2012. We&rsquo;re confident our race was a significant contributor toward the goal.</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re privileged that Oscar Robertson, NBA legend and a prostate cancer survivor himself, served as our Honorary Chair for the event. He was a tremendous asset in the weeks leading up to the race as we promoted it to the Cincinnati community. Just as importantly he did more than make an appearance on Saturday. He arrived early and very humbly used his great stature to help lift the tops of booth tents so rainwater could drain off. He then shared breakfast with several dozen fellow survivors (and Rob Williams of Fox 19) before making his way to the main stage.</p>
<p>
	The Urology Group shared a unique page in its history at this year&rsquo;s race by dedicating our new advanced surgery center. The new facility offers Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky residents some of the most progressive urologic care under one roof in the nation.</p>
<p>
	On behalf of Dr. Gary Kirsh, President of The Urology Group, Earl Walz, CEO, and Dr. Philip Buffington, Chief Medical Officer, I&rsquo;d like to thank the Greater Cincinnati community for supporting this important cause in men&rsquo;s health. Together we can improve the lives of men throughout the Tri-state who are fighting prostate cancer.</p>

	Many know Cincinnati as the birthplace of pro baseball and America&rsquo;s chili capital. In the acquisition of highly specialized equipment for our new surgery center, The Urology Group is positioning the city for another exciting distinction -- the national and ultimately international go-to destination for the treatment of kidney stones.</p>
<p>
	The group has acquired from Siemens a diagnostic imaging system, and high tech equipment called a Lithoskop, that are one-of-a-kind in North America. Dr. Thorsten Bergsdorf, of Germany, visited Cincinnati in September to conduct training for physician members of our practice on the Lithoskop. As a result, we&rsquo;ll become a national training hub on the use of the technology, and ultimately we&rsquo;ll train physicians from around the world. I&rsquo;d like to note that Dr. Bergsdorf is a leader in this field of medicine.</p>
<p>
	Nearly 12 percent of men and 5 percent of women in the United States deal with kidney stones during their lives and many describe the ordeal as the worst pain they&#39;ve ever experienced. According to industry data, U.S. medical care for kidney stone removal and pain relief carries a $5.3 billion a year price tag.</p>
<p>
	Our center performs over 2000 lithotripsy treatments per year, more than any center in the country. This new machine provides better imaging of the stones and delivers more power to break up the stone than the machine we used previously, or other machines in the country.</p>

18,Everyone Pees,"Adult Americans who have celebrated the experience of raising toddlers at any point in the last 40 years likely are familiar with Everyone Poops, the children’s classic  from Taro Gomi about one of life’s more salient biological facts.","<p>
	Adult Americans who have celebrated the experience of raising toddlers at any point in the last 40 years likely are familiar with <em>Everyone Poops</em>, the children&rsquo;s classic from Taro Gomi about one of life&rsquo;s more salient biological facts.</p>
<p>
	A book geared to an entirely different stage in life might well be titled, Everyone Pees.</p>
<p>
	Upon opening that book, the question becomes, for some of us, how much do we pee? Or more to the point, how much is too much?</p>
<p>
	Perhaps it&rsquo;s best to illustrate the signs that a person is peeing too often by using a&nbsp; selection of everyday references. You&rsquo;re peeing too often if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You know the location of every bathroom in the city&hellip;just in case</li>
	<li>
		You wake up tired because of so many night time trips to the bathroom</li>
	<li>
		You can&#39;t get through a movie without several trips to the toilet</li>
	<li>
		You&#39;re buying pads, but it&#39;s not that time of the month and you&#39;re too old for diapers</li>
</ul>
<p>
	These experiences may seem familiar, and even a bit funny. But it&rsquo;s wise to take bladder control issues &ndash; our own or those of our loved ones &ndash; seriously.</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s another set of signals, expressed in doctor-speak. It&rsquo;s time to see a urologist:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If a person regularly voids more frequently than once every two hours</li>
	<li>
		If frequent urges to void are interfering with daily life, work or sleep</li>
	<li>
		If a person is bothered by wearing pads for urinary protection</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Sometimes friends or family notice before the patient does.&nbsp;Patients will tell their urologist, &ldquo;My friends or co-workers make fun of how often I go to the bathroom,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;My spouse can&#39;t sleep anymore because I&rsquo;m getting up so often and I keep her (or him) awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s a word to the wise for anyone challenged by bladder control issues &ndash; <strong>Interstim</strong>. Interstim therapy is a treatment option that uses mild electrical impulses to modulate the nerves that control the bladder and nerves that control the muscles related to urination.</p>
<p>
	A patient is a candidate for Interstim therapy if he or she has frequent, sometimes uncontrollable urges to void that are not responsive to conservative therapy such as medication or behavioral changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Interstim therapy also is indicated for urinary retention in the absence of obstruction. Additionally, Interstim is indicated for bowel control in patients with fecal incontinence that has not been responsive to conservative management with medication, diet and behavioral changes.</p>
<p>
	The good news is that Interstim can improve incontinence symptoms, frequency and urgency, by greater than 50 percent without the side effects of medication.</p>

12,Separating Urinary Tract from Fiction,Urinary facts and fiction,"<p>
	The urinary tract (and the urine it produces) is a hard-working system that rids the body of waste left behind once all the essential nutrients have been taken in from food and drink. Urine can tell a healthcare professional a lot about the health of not just your kidneys, but also about the health of your heart, liver and other systems within your body.</p>
<div>
	While most of us spend virtually no time thinking about our urinary tract, nearly all of us have, over time, heard a host of interesting tidbits about our urine &ndash; some true, some not so true. Here&rsquo;s a helpful guide to separating urinary &ldquo;tract from fiction.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Is Urine Actually Indicative of Overall Health?</strong></div>
<div>
	A great deal about a person&rsquo;s health can be determined by a simple urine test, which is why doctor visits routinely include a urine sample. This is because urine reveals important information about the function of the kidneys, heart and liver. Excess protein in the urine, for example, can be an indicator of kidney disease; and, has also been linked to risk for heart disease.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Not only is urine content a good indicator of the health of certain organs, but how many times a day you produce urine is also revealing. The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; number of times each day that urine is produced varies from one person to another. There are still certain medical conditions, however, that can be linked to frequent urination. These include diabetes and urinary tract infections (UTIS), as well as having an enlarged prostate. Lower than usual urination can suggest kidney problems or dehydration. It is important to know what is normal for yourself; and, consult with your doctor any time your urine output varies from your normal. (If you&rsquo;d like to track your urination patterns check out this handy <a href=""http://www.urologygroup.com/Media/260/TUGVoidingDiary.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Voiding Diary</a> on our website.)</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Does Urine Odor Suggest Problems?</strong></div>
<div>
	Everyone&rsquo;s heard the age-old story that asparagus can cause urine to smell funny. But the truth is that not everyone experiences this side effect. In fact, it&rsquo;s true in only about half of asparagus eaters. On a more serious note, however, certain health conditions can affect urine smell. For example, diabetes, which can cause a slightly sweet scent, and urinary tract infections both can cause urine to have a strange odor. It&rsquo;s important to talk to your doctor about any strange urine smell.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Does What You Eat Affect Urine Color?</strong></div>
<div>
	The color of urine can tell us a good many things. Normal urine is a light yellow color. But if a person becomes dehydrated, then the urine might be darker or even brownish in color. The color of urine can also change with your diet. Eating beets, for example, could cause urine to turn slightly red. Certain medications might also turn urine different colors. If, however, urine becomes a rusty color or contains any traces of blood, this could be indicative of a kidney infection or urinary tract infection. In this case, contacting your physician is very important.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Is Urine Really Sterile?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	It&rsquo;s both yes and no to this one. Ancient Aztecs actually believed that urine was so sterile it was a good antiseptic for use in disinfecting wounds. While urine still in the bladder is normally sterile and free of bacteria, once it leaves your body, it begins to pick up bacteria from the urethra and the surrounding area. Knowing that urine is no longer sterile once it leaves the body, we would recommend that minor cuts and scrapes are best treated with soap and water and a good antiseptic.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Seriously, Is Urine Really Drinkable?</strong></div>
<div>
	Survivalist Bear Grylls, the star of the Discovery Channel&rsquo;s Man vs. Wild, has raised considerable awareness about urotherapy (drinking one&rsquo;s own urine) as a means of survival in extreme circumstances. The human kidneys are designed to rid the body of waste. Wisdom, then, would suggest that humans probably don&rsquo;t want to ingest anything that our body has deemed &ldquo;waste&rdquo; and has rid from our systems. Of course, in a situation where one is truly desperate for survival, urine can be distilled using the sun&rsquo;s heat to separate water vapors from the other components such as salt, potassium and urea.</div>
<div>

<div>
	<strong>Does Urine Really Help Jellyfish Stings?</strong></div>
<div>
	While there was a really hilarious episode of &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; in which Joey and Chandler came to Monica&rsquo;s aid after she was stung by a jellyfish, this commonly held belief is really just a beach myth. Tests on a variety of home remedies, including urine, meat tenderizer, alcohol and baking soda determined that none were as effective as simply washing the stung area in hot water and applying lidocaine, a topical anesthetic that numbs the skin and relieves pain. It&rsquo;s available over-the-counter as a gel, liquid or spray. So the next time you&rsquo;re stung by a jellyfish, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about dealing with the pain as well as pondering whether someone needs to urinate on the area of your sting.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Can Urine Soften Your Skin?</strong></div>
<div>
	After spending considerable sums of money on moisturizer, most people would be surprised to know that urea, which is a major component of urine, does have skin-softening properties. A synthetic version of urea is included in many moisturizing creams. Urea (in both natural and synthetic forms) helps skin retain its natural moisture and is also a good exfoliant. It&rsquo;s also a common ingredient in athlete&rsquo;s foot treatments, which may explain why, but we suggest purchasing it, again, in its synthetic, over-the-counter form rather than going for the naturally occurring version.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Does Coffee Cause More Frequent Urination?</strong></div>
<div>
	It&rsquo;s true. Coffee does indeed cause more frequent urination. This is because the caffeine in coffee inhibits antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which works to keep the water levels in your body in balance. When ADH is blocked, the kidneys get a signal to release excess water, which causes urination. Tea, colas, energy drinks and even alcohol are also ADH inhibitors.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Does Urine Work as a Teeth Whitener?</strong></div>
<div>
	Believe it or not, ancient Roman physicians recommended rinsing the mouth with urine as a way to get sparkling white teeth. It wasn&rsquo;t actually the urine that made teeth whiter. It was the ammonia that occurs naturally in urine that made these ancient teeth sparkle. The 18th-century French physician, Pierre Fauchard, known as the father of modern dentistry, recommended urine rinses to relieve toothache. Today, however, dentists strongly encourage tooth-whitening products that contain peroxide to brighten smiles; and, a visit to your dental office for any toothache you might have. &nbsp;</div>

	If you visit one of our offices during the month of November you might notice some changes with a few of our docs. They&rsquo;ll be a bit hairier.</p>
<p>
	Let me explain.</p>
<p>
	A number of physicians will be growing mustaches or &ldquo;Mos&rdquo; to mark the month of Movember, a month dedicated to men&rsquo;s health causes. We&rsquo;ll be raising awareness and funds for prostate and testicular cancers in particular.</p>
<p>
	Physicians and staff will also sport stickers that say, &ldquo;Ask me about Movember!&rdquo; to spread the word. Offices will be outfitted with donation jars and flyers that encourage patients, family and friends to get involved in the cause.</p>
<p>
	Those interested in making a donation electronically can visit our official Movember &amp; Sons <a href=""http://us.movember.com/team/638113"">donation page</a>. Donors can decide if they want to support a specific physician or the team as a whole.</p>
<p>
	We expect the competition between physicians to get a bit hairy, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve also created a <a href=""http://movember2012.wordpress.com/"">website</a> that will help document the growth in pictures, providing photo updates on all participating physicians&rsquo; mos.</p>
<p>
	Most exciting of all at the end of November, our physicians will participate in a <a href=""http://movember2012.wordpress.com/the-event/"">public shaving</a> at Local&rsquo;s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, 19 East Seventh Street between Vine and Walnut. I urge everyone to attend &mdash; it&rsquo;s sure to be a fun night, with money raised benefitting prostate cancer research and men&rsquo;s health education.<br />
	<br />
	I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of this great team of physicians and staff members and I look forward to what Movember may bring.</p>

	Recently, as I hurried between appointments in our Norwood facility, it struck me just how much my work and surroundings have changed in the past year. And I felt surrounded by fortune.</p>
<p>
	The year began, after all, with concrete and color swatches &ndash; a building in the early stages of construction and a brand image forming (and changing) on paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Now, the year ends with the Urology Group&rsquo;s expanded headquarters and state-of-the art surgery facility, a new website and a notably heightened awareness of the preventative care needed to improve the health of men and women in the region.</p>
<p>
	We at the Urology Group have so much for which to be thankful, and a lot of it was delivered through the care and dedication of our staff and community:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Reduced prostate cancer deaths<strong>. </strong>According to the <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-key-statistics"" target=""_blank"">American Cancer Society</a>, about one in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. But thanks to heightened awareness and preventative care, only one in 36 men die from the disease.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			New state-of-the-art equipment. The Urology Group&rsquo;s $3 million investment in kidney stone treatment, including a diagnostic imaging system and a high-tech lithotripter that uses shockwaves to break down the stones, make us one-of-a-kind in North America.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Community outreach. Between the Urology Group&rsquo;s sixth annual Great Prostate Cancer Challenge race and walk, and our fundraising efforts this month through Movember (during which 11 doctors grew mustaches for the cause), we have raised nearly $90,000 toward prostate health and awareness.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Improved investment in care. The global urology devices market is expected to double in size from 2011 to 2012 &ndash; to $8.6 billion from $4.4 billion, according to the business-intelligence firm <a href=""http://www.visiongain.com/Report/925/Urology-Devices-World-Market-Outlook-2012-2022"" target=""_blank"">Visiongain</a>. Much of that investment &ndash; $3 billion &ndash; will be earmarked toward urinary continence treatment.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			I am grateful for a full schedule of appointments, and for the improved health of my patients, who understand the importance of making regular, preventative visits.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Our year started with color swatches, but it is ending in flying colors, and for that we are all very grateful &ndash; to our families, friends, patients and partners.</p>
<p>
	Best wishes for a warm, wonderful Thanksgiving, shared with those you love.</p>

17,"New Year’s Resolution for Better Urinary Health, in Six Steps",Dr. Shay shares six resolutions for a year of better urinary health.,"<p>
	<img alt=""WomanBike"" class=""right"" src=""/Media/323/NewYearBlog.jpg"" /></p>
<br />
<p>
	The famed Roman poet Virgil said more than 2,000 years ago, &ldquo;The greatest wealth is health.&rdquo; As another year passes between his time and ours, the substance of these sage words has not diminished a speck.</p>
<p>
	Yet everyday, I am sure most of us catch ourselves doing something that is not in the best interest of our health. We cannot always help that &ndash; the demands of our workday lives often force us to sit too long, to rush too much, and to feel a bit of stress.</p>
<p>
	Fortunately, there are a few practices we can adopt to help offset these unhealthy situations. I&rsquo;d like to share my resolutions for one more year of better urinary health:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Drink water when you feel thirsty:</strong> One of the best and most affordable preventative measures against kidney stones and urinary tract infections is water. Medical evidence suggests that drinking too few fluids can exacerbate a chemical oversaturation of the urine, causing stones to form. Further, increased water will dilute the urinary stream and enable the body to flush bacteria before an infection can begin.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Learn how to perform self-examinations:</strong> Not every event that occurs beneath our skin requires an X-ray for detection. Scrotal masses are relatively easy to catch during a self-examination, which is recommended on a monthly basis. A scrotal mass is a lump or bulge that may indicate enlarged veins, inflammation, or cancerous or non-cancerous growths. Early detection means better chances of recovery.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Have a regular PSA screening:</strong> All men over the age of 50 should commit to annual PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screenings, a blood test that measures the level of proteins produced by cells of the prostate. A&nbsp;man is 35 percent more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than a woman is to be diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Yet if detected early,&nbsp;prostate cancer is nearly 100 percent treatable.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Monitor your use of pain medication</strong>: I&#39;d like to use another quote here, by Benjamin Franklin: &ldquo;The best doctor gives the least medicines.&rdquo; True enough, the prolonged uses of pain medications, both prescription and over the counter, have been shown to increase the risk of kidney cancer. A 2011 study found that regular use of non-aspirin anti-inflammatory painkillers &ndash;&nbsp;by both men and women &ndash; raised the likelihood of kidney cancer by more than 50 percent.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Don&#39;t smoke: </strong>The chances of contracting or dying from bladder, kidneys or prostate cancer are significantly elevated if you smoke. For example, the risk of bladder and kidney cancer is twice as high among cigarette smokers than nonsmokers. And recent research shows smokers diagnosed with prostate cancer are more likely than nonsmokers to die of the disease or experience a recurrence.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Perform Kegel exercises: </strong>Many people wrongly assume that Kegels are strictly for women, but men can benefit as well. The exercise, which involves strongly contracting the pelvic muscles used to hold back urine, reinforces those muscles and can tighten and strengthen the pelvic floor. Kegels may be prescribed for both men and women with incontinence and for women with pelvic floor prolapse.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The poet Virgil died in 21 BC, at the ripe old age of 51. We are fortunate to have much longer lifelines, but our extended time also exposes us to health issues unheard of in Virgil&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>
	The onus is on us to keep healthy bodies because, as another sage man once said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only place you have to live.&rdquo;</p>

16,UTI risk increases with age,A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection that occurs anywhere along the urinary tract.,"<p>
	A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection that occurs anywhere along the urinary tract. The urinary tract comprises:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Kidneys, which process urine.</li>
	<li>
		Bladder, which stores urine.</li>
	<li>
		Ureters, tubes that transfer urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</li>
	<li>
		Urethra, a tube that empties urine from the bladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Although anyone can get a UTI, the elderly are especially susceptible and often suffer more severe symptoms. The elderly are more vulnerable mainly because their aging and weakened immune systems leave them more susceptible to infections in general.</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s not uncommon for elderly men and women to have weakened bladder muscles, which can lead to an increase in residual urine volume, inefficient emptying of the bladder and incontinence. The ability to empty the bladder completely during urination is particularly important in terms of UTI prevention because it keeps bacteria from accumulating within the bladder. Those with weakened bladder muscles such as the elderly tend to retain urine in the bladder thus leaving them more open to bacterial infections.<br />
	<br />
	In elderly men, an enlarged prostate can obstruct the flow of urination and cause urine stagnation. In elderly women, bladder prolapse, caused by a weakness in the supporting structures, can also lead to urine stagnation. Regardless of the cause, stagnant urine in the bladder becomes a breeding ground for bacterial growth and colonization, which cause UTIs.<br />
	<br />
	Because the elderly immune system can be weak, it may fail to generate a normal response to infection, such as fever. This can make it difficult for early UTI detection. Consequently, UTIs among the elderly can become serious before they are even detected. Also problematic, the symptoms of a UTI in the elderly can resemble those of dementia or even Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, delaying proper diagnosis.<br />
	<br />
	For a speedy and accurate diagnosis of a UTI, it is important that the elderly be closely monitored for characteristic signs. Symptoms may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Urine that appears cloudy</li>
	<li>
		Bloody urine</li>
	<li>
		Strong or foul-smelling urine odor</li>
	<li>
		Frequent or urgent need to urinate</li>
	<li>
		Pain or burning with urination</li>
	<li>
		Pressure in the lower pelvis</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Once properly diagnosed, the most common treatment for a UTI is a course of antibiotics.<br />
	<br />
	Sometimes, a UTI can be the result of catheterization, in which case catheter use should be minimized; or, the catheter should be replaced more frequently. It is recommended that family members speak with the elderly patient&rsquo;s physician or nursing staff to see what the schedule is for changing the catheter and to ensure the schedule is followed.<br />
	<br />
	As with any infection, the best treatment is prevention. UTIs among the elderly can be minimized by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Avoiding fluids known to irritate the bladder, such as alcohol, caffeine or soft drinks.</li>
	<li>
		Drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry supplement tablets, but only if the patient (or family) has no history of kidney stones.</li>
	<li>
		Drinking plenty of water.</li>
	<li>
		Keeping the genital area clean. If an elderly patient uses adult diapers, they must be changed regularly.</li>
	<li>
		Wearing cloth, preferably cotton, undergarments.</li>
	<li>
		Always wiping from front to back (for women).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Anyone living with or caring for an elderly family member should be aware of the potential for UTIs. Knowing how to avoid a UTI and knowing what symptoms to look out for can make all the difference in a patient&#39;s quality of life.</p>

19,Treatments for Pelvic Prolapse Offer Women Hope,Dr. Buffington discusses the treatment options for pelvic prolapse,"<p>
	Once rarely discussed or recognized, pelvic prolapse or pelvic floor weakness has now become a priority in women&rsquo;s health. The problem is so prevalent that by age 80, more than one in every 10 women will have undergone surgery for prolapse.</p>
<p>
	Today, many primary care physicians and gynecologists routinely screen patients for the symptoms, but urologists are the true experts in treating prolapse conditions and the urinary incontinence that often results.</p>
<p>
	Women with mild prolapse discovered during a routine pelvic exam may have no symptoms at all. But others experience considerable discomfort and a range of symptoms, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Pressure and pain. The most common complaints are a feeling of pelvic pressure, or bearing down, leg fatigue and low back pain.</li>
	<li>
		Urinary symptoms. Cystocele (bladder) and uterine prolapse can cause stress incontinence and difficulty in starting to urinate.</li>
	<li>
		Bowel symptoms. A rectocele (rectum prolapse) may cause problems with defecation by forming a pocket just above the anal sphincter. Stool can become trapped, causing pain, pressure and constipation.</li>
	<li>
		Sexual problems. A prolapse can cause irritated vaginal tissues or pain during intercourse, as well as psychological stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you think you have a pelvic prolapse condition, a traditional pelvic examination is the only way to diagnose it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Treating Pelvic Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>
	Women with very mild symptoms may not need treatment, although they should avoid anything that might worsen the prolapse. It is often a good idea to lose weight if necessary, avoid lifting heavy objects, and quit smoking to prevent prolapses from progressing. Prolapse doesn&rsquo;t necessarily worsen over time, so there&rsquo;s no need to seek aggressive treatments, unless symptoms get worse.</p>
<p>
	Nonsurgical treatments include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Activity modification: The physician may recommend activity modification such as avoiding heavy lifting or straining.</li>
	<li>
		Pessary: This is a small plastic or silicone medical device similar to a diaphragm or cervical cap that&rsquo;s inserted in the vagina to help support the pelvic area.</li>
	<li>
		Kegel exercises: Simple strengthening exercises that can tighten the muscles of the pelvic floor.</li>
	<li>
		Estrogen replacement therapy. Estrogen helps strengthen and maintain muscles in the vagina.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Practicing Kegel exercises help to strengthen the pelvic floor and reduce the chance that mild condition will progress. Kegel exercises are a series of contractions that strengthen the pelvic floor. You squeeze two sets of pelvic floor muscles at the same time: those you would use to prevent yourself from passing gas and those you would tighten to stop urinating.</p>
<p>
	Surgical options:</p>
<p>
	For women who are experiencing major discomfort or inconvenience, surgery is the only definitive way to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Vaginal surgery with mesh: The physician uses a mesh &ldquo;kit&rdquo; to pull the vagina up to the sacrospinous ligament (near the sacrum, the triangular bone just above the tailbone). The FDA recently warned that mesh could introduce risks that are not present in traditional non-mesh surgery, including: mesh erosion (exposure of the mesh in the vagina); mesh contracture (shrinkage); pelvic pain; pain with intercourse; bleeding; and infection.</li>
	<li>
		<a href=""http://theurologygroup.net/services-we-offer/female-urology-clinic/"">Robotic surgery using mesh (sacrocolpopexy)</a>: For treatment of prolapse for women who have had a hysterectomy. In the procedure, the surgeon connects the prolapsed vagina to the sacrum (the triangular bone just above the tailbone) using an artificial tissue material called a mesh. The Urology Group uses the da Vinci Surgical System for these procedures, which is similar to laparoscopy with small incisions, but with the more precise movements of the robot. Considered the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for prolapse surgery, this procedure can only be done in women who have had a hysterectomy or it can be done in conjunction with a hysterectomy. The FDA warning about mesh does not apply to this procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Vaginal surgery without mesh: This treatment involves repair with either a suture or with biological material, such as pigskin. However, the repair may not have the longevity of robotic sacrocolpopexy.</p>

20,The Urology Group Stands Behind Importance of Life-Saving PSA Cancer Screenings,"The physicians at The Urology Group are big supporters of vigorous debate, especially when it comes to patients’ health and the choices they make.","<p>
	The physicians at The Urology Group are big supporters of vigorous debate, especially when it comes to patients&rsquo; health and the choices they make. But recent reports that question the necessity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests for prostate cancer force us to get out in front of the issue and defend the importance of the screenings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Data continues to confirm that early testing for prostate cancer, in particular the use of the PSA test, has contributed to the decline in prostate cancer deaths by nearly 40 percent over the last 20 years. Indeed, The Urology Group alone has treated thousands of patients with prostate cancer and we know for a fact that the early detection the PSA makes possible is the key to recovery and survival. This is particularly the case among high-risk groups such as men with a history of prostate cancer and African American men.</p>
<p>
	But we also know that it is <em>always</em> the patient&rsquo;s decision regarding the course of treatment, whether to watch and wait or have surgery.</p>
<p>
	Here are some prostate cancer facts for patients and families to consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in American men, second only to lung cancer.</li>
	<li>
		One in six men will get prostate cancer at some point and nearly 30,000 men will die from the disease this year.</li>
	<li>
		One in 12,000 men under age 40 will be diagnosed.</li>
	<li>
		African American men carry the highest rate of prostate cancer in the U.S. with an incidence rate 60 percent higher. They are two-and-a-half times more likely to die from the disease than men of any other ethnic group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The PSA debate is not a new one; we have made our case before and will continue to do so as long as we believe that PSA screenings save lives. Like any physician, we are in the field because we want to provide advanced care and improve the health of our patients. To support that mission, The Urology Group has invested in an active clinical trials program researching new treatments for a variety of urologic conditions, including prostate cancer (<a href=""http://theurologygroup.cc/clinical-trials/"">www.urologygroup.cc/clinical-trials</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Knowledge empowers you with choice. My advice to all men 50 and older, or to men who are 40 and are African American or have a family history of prostate cancer, is to make a prostate exam a part of your annual checkup. We know screening works and will continue to be an advocate.</p>

21,More Than Skin-deep  – BOTOX® Treatment Option Offered at The Urology Group,"Overactive bladder is a condition that affects an estimated 33 million Americans, including a large percentage of my patients.","<p>
	Overactive bladder is a condition that affects an estimated 33 million Americans, including a large percentage of my patients. It&rsquo;s always great to have another treatment option, particularly one that offers a simple procedure in place of medications or a more invasive surgery.</p>
<p>
	So, after participating in a clinical trials program we are thrilled here at The Urology Group that BOTOX<sup>&reg;</sup>, the widely used wrinkle-removing injection, is actually adding overactive bladder to its growing list of medical condition treatments.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially expanded its <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm336101.htm"">approval</a> of BOTOX<sup>&reg;</sup> (onabotulinumtoxinA) as a viable treatment option for adults with overactive bladder who cannot use or do not adequately respond to traditional medications. (Until a couple of weeks ago, Botox was only approved for patients with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.)</p>
<p>
	Overactive bladder is a condition that affects both men and women. Symptoms include frequency of urination, a feeling of urgency to urinate, accidents or leakage from inability to reach the restroom in time and waking up at least twice a night to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>
	Normal bladder function involves communication between the nervous system&nbsp;and the muscles that make up the bladder wall.&nbsp;The nerves send signals to the bladder muscles, telling them to contract when the bladder is full.&nbsp;In patients with overactive bladder, those nerve signals occur more suddenly and frequently &mdash; even when the bladder is not full.&nbsp;This is where the BOTOX<sup>&reg;</sup> treatment is most effective.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s a relatively simple procedure that requires injecting the drug into the bladder during cystoscopy (a medical procedure that lets a doctor see inside the bladder.) It sometimes requires general anesthesia. BOTOX<sup>&reg;</sup> works by relaxing the bladder, thus allowing it to store more urine. The effects can last from four to six months.</p>
<p>
	The upside for patients is the technique may be repeated, with at least 12 weeks between each treatment. As with most treatments, there are possible side effects, including urinary tract infections, painful urination and incomplete emptying of the bladder. However, this new treatment is promising for patients with chronic bladder control issues.</p>

22,VasMadness – Doctor’s Note for Watching Games,Vasectomies are one of the most common procedures performed by urologists at The Urology Group.,"<p>
	Vasectomies are one of the most common procedures performed by urologists at The Urology Group. Yet, there are still a lot of questions, uncertainty and misperceptions concerning this procedure. The number one thing you should know? It&rsquo;s a quick, virtually painless and highly successful office procedure.</p>
<p>
	The benefits are clear for any man considering a vasectomy. It is the most effective form of birth control, which can simply improve intimacy with partners by reducing worry of unplanned pregnancies.</p>
<p>
	Also, it&rsquo;s easy. This quick (about 20 minutes) outpatient procedure is non-invasive. Most insurance companies cover vasectomies, as it is considerably more cost effective when compared to alternative birth control methods. Even without insurance, a typical vasectomy costs only about $700.</p>
<p>
	Finally, the biggest thing men want to know is what happens after the procedure.</p>
<p>
	The procedure does not alter hormone levels such as testosterone, and therefore will not affect your libido, sex drive or ability to get an erection. Men perform just as they did before their vasectomies, but without the stress of an unplanned pregnancy!</p>
<p>
	Recovery is minimal, only requiring one or two days off work, which is why VasMadness is the perfect time to schedule a vasectomy. Men can get the procedure done and take a day or two off work to watch the NCAA basketball tournament.</p>
<p>
	The Urology Group is dedicating several doctors&rsquo; schedules on Wednesday afternoon, March 20 and Thursday morning, March 21 for vasectomies, with games tipping off that day. We are partnering with WEBN-FM and Alamo Electronics to offer a <a href=""http://theurologygroup.net/calendar-of-events/2013/03/01/vas-madness/"">grand prize giveaway of a 42&rdquo; TV</a> during the month of March.

	In the 1990 movie &ldquo;Awakenings,&rdquo; a neurologist played by Robin Williams performs clinical research using a test drug to rouse patients from a catatonic state. The drug, L-Dopa, did not prove effective in that case, but its promise was further explored and it continues to be used successfully today on a wide range of conditions, including Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>

	The point of this story is that without the clinical trials, the power of a treatment would never have been known. Every day, the medical community is seeking new, more effective approaches to curing patients, and clinical research is crucial to that. This is a fact at the Cleveland Clinic as much as it is at The Urology Group. For instance, we recently concluded research that involved the use of Botox&nbsp;as a viable&nbsp;treatment option for adults with&nbsp;overactive bladder.</p>
<p>
	By participating in a clinical trial, patients play a more active role in their own health care by accessing new treatments, and they help others by contributing to medical research. At the Urology Group, several trials are scheduled and underway. There is never a charge for being in one of our studies. In fact, many of our studies include a stipend. Are you interested? See below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Urology Group is performing multiple studies for new therapies for advancing prostate cancer.</li>
	<li>
		We are conducting a study to evaluate the effects of a recently approved medication for erectile dysfunction (ED) on sperm production. Healthy men (ages 18-45) and men with mild ED are eligible for this study.</li>
	<li>
		We routinely do multiple studies for people with overactive bladder (those who find themselves going to the bathroom too frequently and having trouble with urinary leakage). There will be several trials, evaluating various medications, to hopefully control this problem.</li>
	<li>
		Shortly, we will be participating in several studies for interstitial cystitis (IC). We are seeking women with this condition to participate in the trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The movie &ldquo;Awakenings&rdquo; has a melancholy ending &ndash;&nbsp;the drug did not work, but the surgeon involved learned a lesson in the value of living life to its fullest. By offering and participating in trials, we all strive to do the same.</p>

25,The Prostate and the Pill,"To many people, BPH may sound like the name of a new fuel station chain.","<p>
	To many people, BPH may sound like the name of a new fuel station chain. But to millions of men, the initials BPH represent a different kind of pain at the pump.</p>
<p>
	BPH stands for benign prostatic hyperplasia, or enlarged prostate, and to many men, it signals the beginning of a prolonged and often unpleasant medication regime, due to allergies and side effects.</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re not talking a slight inconvenience for a small number of men here. More than half of American men in their sixties and as many as 90 percent in their seventies have symptoms of enlarged prostate. As the condition worsens, the tissue surrounding the gland restricts its expansion, causing it to press against the urethra and impede urination. Not surprisingly, this results in discomfort and pain, so learning your options beforehand will put you at an advantage of a faster recovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Several drugs can treat BPH by relaxing the prostate and bladder muscles, improving urine flow. Other drugs inhibit production of the hormone DHT, which is involved in prostate enlargement.</p>
<p>
	But a lot of drugs do have known side effects, including lightheadedness, vomiting, swelling and irregular heart beat. For some patients, these side effects can interfere with work, family and daily tasks.</p>
<p>
	So it is important to know that medications, while common, are not the only course of treatment. Just like you have choices at the fuel station, you do have other options to treat BHP. One of them, transurethral microwave thermotherapy, is a common outpatient treatment during which the excess tissue is burned away using microwave heat applied by a tiny, urethral catheter.</p>
<p>
	Other services include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Transurethral resection of the prostate: In this procedure, a small electrical loop inserted through the penis cuts away at obstructing tissue while sealing blood vessels.</li>
	<li>
		Transurethral vaporization of the prostate: Here, a tiny instrument with an electrode or laser fiber is passed through the urethra and vaporizes the obstructing tissue.</li>
	<li>
		Open surgery: In cases when the prostate is very large, a surgical incision will be required to remove obstructing prostate tissue.</li>
	<li>
		Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate (HoLEP): This newer treatment involves the removal of the entire obstruction using a vaporizing laser, so no incision is required. HoLEP treatment is reserved for larger prostates and is limited in availability, but it is offered as at The Urology Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The old line goes that an informed consumer is a better customer. This goes for personal health care as well as for food or gas. By learning today what you may need to know tomorrow, you will be halfway to putting your health care decisions in the rearview mirror.</p>

	What do Robert De Niro, Colin Powell, Nelson Mandela and Arnold Palmer have in common? Hint: It&rsquo;s not a good golf game.</p>
<p>
	Turns out, the four well-known men all suffered from prostate cancer at one point in their lives. They all have since recovered and, reportedly, Arnold Palmer was even able to play golf just eight weeks after his surgery.</p>
<p>
	These famous men are not alone in their prostate cancer survivorships. In fact, one in six American men over the age of 50 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, but with early detection and proper treatment, most of those men will not suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>
	At The Urology Group, we feel so strongly about the benefits to preventative prostate care that we&rsquo;ve partnered with local organizations to offer free screenings and examinations. Tomorrow, April 11, a number of our physicians will be at the Sharonville Convention Center to assist with the first of many free prostate exams and PSA screenings this year. I urge men over 40 who haven&rsquo;t had their prostate checked recently to attend and be examined.</p>
<p>
	Because prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms unless it has spread outside the prostate, preventative care is particularly important. Urologists typically diagnose prostate cancer using a combination of patient history and physical exams including PSA tests. Early testing such as the PSA test has contributed to the decline in prostate cancer death rates by nearly 40 percent over the last two decades.</p>
<p>

29,Can Doctors Tell When Patients Shade the Truth?,A recent article in the Wall Street Journal health section caught my attention because it focused on an important aspect of the patient-doctor relationship.,"<p>
	<img alt=""Doctor"" class=""left"" height=""226"" src=""/Media/346/TUGDocBlog.jpg"" width=""332"" />A recent article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> health section caught my attention because it focused on an important aspect of the patient-doctor relationship. The article was about patients who leave out facts or are not entirely accurate in the information they share with their doctor.</p>
<p>
	The <em>WSJ </em>article -- and life experience -- tell us it&#39;s human nature to be less than forthcoming about our diet, how much we exercise, if we&#39;ve quit smoking, or, importantly, whether we&#39;ve taken our medication as directed. Some patients play down symptoms, others exaggerate them.</p>
<p>
	The reasons for shading the truth are many and varied. Patients, naturally, don&#39;t want to be embarrassed or criticized. Some feel they&#39;ll be judged, some fear disappointing their doctor. Sometimes symptoms are downplayed out of fear of an illness, treatment or even going to the hospital.</p>
<p>
	So the question arises: Can doctors tell? Can they detect anxiety or notice when a patient avoids eye contact?</p>
<p>
	While I have no formal training in this area, I have a lot of experience listening and talking to patients. Yes, sometimes we can tell.</p>
<p>
	The important takeaway here is this: It&#39;s always better to tell your doctor the whole truth, as accurately as possible. To do otherwise can lead to serious health problems stemming from diagnostic inaccuracy or the wrong treatment plan.</p>
<p>
	For doctors at The Urology Group, candor and openness is critical to providing effective care. That may take some courage. In the prevention of prostate cancer for example, it&#39;s crucial for men to face up to the worries and anxieties attendant to digital rectal exams and the PSA test. Lives can be saved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That brings us to the final question. Do doctors ever shade?</p>
<p>
	Let me assure you that trust is sacred in the relationship. As doctors, we strive to be both truthful and compassionate in our messaging. We cannot deceive or withhold the truth, but we don&rsquo;t need to beat folks over the head with their illnesses, either.</p>
<p>
	Most patients will instinctively lead us as to how much information they are comfortable receiving about their condition. We try to follow their lead while being truthful at the same time.</p>

30,Robotic Surgery: Three Things You Didn't Know,"The prospect of surgery can be unsettling for anyone, and not just those who get queasy at the sight of a needle.","<p>
	The prospect of surgery can be unsettling for anyone, and not just those who get queasy at the sight of a needle. The possibility of missed work, pain and an extensive recovery can cause many to put off non-urgent but necessary procedures.</p>
<p>
	Fortunately, there are alternatives to open surgery for many conditions, including prostate, kidney and bladder cancers, and robotics is a leading option. In fact, hundreds of thousands of robotic surgeries are performed in the United States every year as patients seek treatments that are less invasive and require reduced hospital stays.</p>
<p>
	Still, there are many things people do not know about robotic surgery. For one thing, the robot is not performing the surgery. Rather, the surgeon performs the procedure with miniaturized instruments, guiding the robotic arms against a three-dimensional image of the surgical field. The system replicates the surgeon&#39;s movements in real time.</p>
<p>
	Here are a few other aspects of robotic surgery that may surprise you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Less blood:</strong> Robotic surgery is associated with fewer blood transfusions when compared with open surgery because it requires minimal incisions and is more precise. This means less blood loss.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Prettier results</strong>: Because of the smaller incisions that robotic surgery requires, patients will experience less pain as well as less scarring, for a potentially better cosmetic result.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Faster recovery:</strong> Since robotic surgery is less invasive to the body, patients are able to return to normal activities quicker than they would with open surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Patients should not put off for tomorrow a surgery that can be successfully, and less invasively, performed today. With robotics, people can recover faster and be back to their regular schedules sooner. There is nothing to fear in that.</p>

34,You’ve been diagnosed with kidney cancer – what’s next?,"Breaking down the diagnosis, treatment and support options for kidney cancer.","<p>
	Whether it&rsquo;s you or someone you love, hearing the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; is a scary thing. But, being informed about the disease and treatment options is an important part of alleviating some of that fear. That&rsquo;s exactly our job as physicians at The Urology Group, especially when it comes to kidney cancer (Renal Cell Cancer, or RCC).</p>
<p>
	Renal cell carcinoma is fairly uncommon. It accounts for 2 to 3% of all adult malignant neoplasms. Approximately 54,000 cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.</p>
<p>
	The first thing you need to know is that you are in good hands. If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, it&rsquo;s important to choose a physician that is specially trained in treating kidney cancer. A urologist is specially trained in treating renal cell carcinoma. Moving forward, this ensures the best-possible treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The second thing you need to know is that you have options when it comes to treatment. So, let&rsquo;s get started by walking through the process.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Diagnosis</u></strong></p>
<p>
	Renal masses can be benign, inflammatory, or malignant. Certain characteristics on radiographic imaging can suggest the appearance of a malignant tumor. If the mass appears to be malignant, we can &ldquo;stage&rdquo; the tumor by closely examining the images.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage I: Growth or tumor no larger than 7 cm found in the kidney.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage II: Tumor is larger than 7 cm but found in the kidney only.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage III: Cancer found in the kidney and extends locally into major veins or perinephric tissues.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage IV: Cancer has spread beyond the kidney.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Treatment</u></strong></p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s imperative to know that every case is unique. There are different options and approaches in treatment depending on each individual&rsquo;s situation. The disease <em>can</em> be successfully treated if it&rsquo;s caught early enough. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveillance: Small renal tumors (&lt;3cm) and elderly patients with multiple medical issues may elect to observe the mass.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgery: By far the most common treatment, though the procedure is based on the stage of the disease and the overall condition of the patient. Depending on the size of the tumor, surgeons may remove a portion of, or the entire kidney. Minimally invasive techniques using laparoscopy or robotics can often replace larger-incision approaches, reducing pain, hospitalization and recovery time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percutaneous therapy: Small tumors can be treated with cryoablation (freezing) or radiofrequency ablation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systemic Therapy: Many new and promising immunologic therapies and targeted molecular approaches are available for the treatment of renal cancer that has spread outside the kidney.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Support</u></strong></p>
<p>
	A large part of being diagnosed with Renal Cell Cancer goes beyond the physiological implications and extends to your mental and emotional state. It&rsquo;s important to find support systems to help you along the journey. Whether its family and friends, an educational seminar, participating in a race for research, or survivors support group &ndash; all of these are just a few examples of interactions or education that will help in your fight against this disease.</p>

113,Snuffing Out a Leading Cause of Bladder Cancer,The Great American Smoke Out - Reducing your risk of bladder cancer,"<p>
	If the smoke getting in your eyes and lungs isn&rsquo;t enough to convince you or loved ones to participate in the <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/great-american-smokeout.html"" target=""_blank"">Great American Smokeout</a> on Nov. 15, then consider this: Smoke gets in your pee. And that&rsquo;s bad news for the bladder.</p>
<p>
	The carcinogens in cigarette smoke ride out the body through the urinary tract. And that means they make a pit-stop in the bladder, exposing it to high concentrations of toxins that can cause bladder cancer.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/23/Delworth.png"" style=""width: 233px; height: 214px; float: right;"" /></p>
<p>
	Smoking tobacco is in fact among the &ldquo;single most-known risk factors&rdquo; of bladder cancer, according to a <a href=""https://health.clevelandclinic.org/surprising-link-smoking-and-bladder-cancer-2/"" target=""_blank"">report by the Cleveland Clinic</a>. Smokers are three-fold more likely to develop bladder cancer than those who never smoked (former smokers are twice as likely), according to an analysis of 89 studies <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/45/3/857/2572678"" target=""_blank"">published in the International Journal of Epidemiology</a>.</p>
<p>
	As a result, more than half of bladder cancers in the U.S. result from smoking, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bladder-cancer-smokers/most-smokers-with-bladder-cancer-know-tobacco-was-the-cause-idUSKCN0IV1S920141111"" target=""_blank"">a study by Kaiser Permanente reports</a>. In 2018, that will net out to more than 40,000 of the 81,190 new cases of bladder cancer estimated to be diagnosed. Most cases, 62,380, will occur in men, but the rate of the disease among women could rise if smoking among the younger female population increases. In 2016, 13.5% of women and 17.5% of men smoked.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>The Hazards of Holding It In</strong></h3>
<p>
	Bladder cancer occurs when the cells begin to grow uncontrollably, eventually forming a tumor. Because the bladder&rsquo;s stretchable walls expand gradually until reaching capacity, it is able to store urine and all that is inside it for hours. If that urine contains carcinogens, then the bladder is exposed to them.</p>
<p>
	Symptoms of bladder cancer include blood in the urine, a burning sensation while urinating, frequent urination and recurrent bladder infections. If you or a loved one experience any of these symptoms, call us to schedule a screening. Even if blood is not visible, microscopic traces can be detected.</p>
<p>
	The good news is that when identified in its early stages, bladder cancer is highly curable &ndash; there&rsquo;s a 77% survival rate in the first five years. But it has to be detected, or better yet, prevented.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>No Butts About Cessation</strong></h3>
<p>
	A variety of precautions, including a diet high in fruits, vegetables and liquids, have been connected with reduced chances of bladder cancer. However, among those who smoke, quitting is the single best move for reducing chances of cancer and improving overall health.</p>
<p>
	For those who want to and/or are trying, know that the odds are leaning toward your success. Today there are more former smokers than current smokers, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. In 2015, 68% of U.S. smokers said they wanted to quit.</p>
<p>
	There are many support programs and cessation tools, such as patches and gum, available. Other tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Consult your doctor for advice and recommendations.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Identify the triggers that cause you to smoke, such as stress or sleepiness, and plan alternate activities like walking.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;"">If it is feasible, change your environment by taking a trip. An alternate routine will help diminish the habitual urge to light up.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Eliminate reminders of smoking, such as matches and ashtrays, and replace them with lollipops, puzzles or mints.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Seek help online or on the phone. The site <a href=""https://smokefree.gov/"" target=""_blank"">smokefree.gov/online</a> helps smokers build quit plans and also offers an app. Smokers also can call <a href=""https://smokefree.gov/tools-tips/get-extra-help/speak-to-an-expert"" target=""_blank"">800-QUIT-NOW or 877-44U-QUIT</a>.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Good luck! And remember, the surest way to keep smoke away from your bladder is by keeping it out of your body.<br />

59,Congress to Act on Important Healthcare Bill Addressing Medicare ,The U.S. Congress is expected to take action on a bill that may fix problems around physicians accepting Medicare patients.,"<p>
	After years of delay, the U.S. Congress is expected to take action on a bill that has the potential to fix the current problems of physicians accepting Medicare patients.</p>
<p>
	Since 1997, healthcare providers have been compensated for services to Medicare patients via a system known as the &quot;SGR.&quot; This system is widely recognized by both Democrats and Republicans to be dysfunctional and outdated. The SGR has led to continual uncertainty for providers and Medicare beneficiaries regarding Medicare payments.</p>
<p>
	In 2014, prominent members of both parties crafted a bipartisan solution to fix this system. This week Congress will vote on implementing this solution, known as the SGR Repeal Bill, which is backed by leadership across party lines. Failure to enact a new system could lead to disruption in patient care.</p>

38,Prostate Cancer Will Be the Most Commonly Diagnosed Cancer for Men in 2014,"According to the American Cancer Society's annual report, prostate cancer will be the most common cancer diagnosis for men in 2014.","<div>
	According to the American Cancer Society (ACS) annual report <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/cancer-statistics-report-deaths-down-20-percent-in-2-decades"">released last week</a>, an estimated 233,000 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, making it the most common cancer affliction for men.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In Ohio alone, nearly 9,000 men will be affected.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The ACS report indicates that the number of prostate cancer diagnoses will slightly exceed breast cancer diagnoses, which many people are surprised to learn. Breast cancer advocates have done an outstanding job the past few decades raising awareness and promoting the importance of women&rsquo;s health and that has likely led to the decline in incidence rates since 2000.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Similar efforts are underway to raise awareness for prostate health. Each year, The Urology Group sponsors and hosts the <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/calendar-of-events/2013/09/13/ZEROProstateCancerRunCincinnati/"">ZERO Prostate Cancer 10K/5K race</a> in September, which coincides with Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. In addition, &ldquo;Movember&rdquo; events have become a global endeavor to promote awareness and early detection each November.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	These efforts help the cause and we endorse them wholeheartedly. However, the ACS report is a reminder that we have a long way to go in combatting prostate cancer. Regular exams for men over 50 are still the key to early detection.&nbsp;</div>

41,Four Steps to Prevent Kidney Stones,"In honor of National Kidney Month, here are four steps to reduce the chances of kidney stones.","<p>
	March is National Kidney Month and March 13 is <a href=""http://www.kidney.org/news/monthly/wkd_aging.cfm?homeslider=aging"" target=""_blank"">World Kidney Day</a>. In honor of these observances, it&rsquo;s a good time to review the basics about kidney health, including kidney stones. According to the <a href=""http://www.kidney.org"" target=""_blank"">National Kidney Foundation</a>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 in 10 Americans will have a kidney stone during his or her lifetime.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year, more than half a million people visit emergency rooms for kidney stone problems.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are much more likely than women to develop kidney stones.</p>
<p>
	Kidney stones form when certain chemicals become concentrated in the urine and form crystals. The crystals grow into larger masses (stones), which can get into the urinary tract. If a stone gets stuck and blocks the flow of urine, it causes pain.</p>
<p>
	You can reduce the risk of kidney stones by:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Drinking plenty of water.</strong> Drinking extra water dilutes the substances in urine that lead to stones. Try to drink enough fluids to pass two liters of urine a day, which is roughly eight standard 8-ounce cups.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Reducing sodium intake.</strong> Too much sodium in the diet can trigger kidney stones. Current guidelines suggest limiting total daily sodium intake to 2,300 mg. If you have a history of kidney stones, try to reduce daily intake to 1,500 mg.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Limiting animal protein.</strong> Eating too much red meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood can boost the level of uric acid and lead to kidney stones. A diet high in protein also reduces levels of citrate, the chemical in urine that helps prevent stones from forming.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Continuing to get the calcium you need.</strong> Calcium in food does not affect the risk of kidney stones; in fact, too little can help cause them. Eat calcium-rich foods unless your doctor advises otherwise. Ask your doctor before taking calcium supplements, as these have been linked to increased risk of kidney stones.</p>
<p>
	Consult with your doctor for resources to meet your specific needs and help you develop a plan that reduces your risk of kidney stones.</p>

42,Reducing Chances for Urinary Tract Infections,"Warmer weather can increase the chances for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women, but some simple precautions can aid in prevention.
","<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">The arrival of warmer weather can increase the chances for women to develop urinary tract infections (UTIs), but some simple precautions can help avoid them.</span></p>
<div>
	Most UTIs are ascending infections of bacteria that colonize the vaginal wall and eventually the urethra. If not treated promptly, the bacteria can infect the bladder or work its way to the kidneys, causing serious complications.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<p>
		To reduce the chances of UTIs, women can follow these guidelines:</p>
	<p>
		&middot; &nbsp;Drink more water. Start with an additional glass with each meal. If urine appears any darker than a very pale yellow, it&rsquo;s an indication to increase the fluid intake.</p>
	<p>
		&middot; &nbsp;Address constipation. Constipation can dilate the rectum, which is located just behind the bladder, and affect the voiding function. When this happens, urine backflows from the urethra to the bladder and causes UTIs. Avoid constipation by increasing fiber in the diet, eating more fruits and vegetables and drinking plenty of fluids.</p>
	<p>
		&middot; &nbsp;Sit properly during urination. When using public restrooms, some women will squat over the toilet to avoid contact with the seat. The best position is to sit on the toilet edge, legs separated but supported and leaning forward slightly, which helps open and relax the pelvic floor. This posture helps ensure the proper emptying of the bladder and reduce the chances of UTIs.</p>
	<p>
		&middot; &nbsp;Take showers and avoid prolonged baths. Bath water can fairly quickly become contaminated by the bather&rsquo;s own skin florae. Sitting in tub allows bacteria to reach the bladder opening area.</p>
	<p>
		&middot; &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t wear tight-fitting undergarments of nonbreathing materials. Moisture can accumulate and be held against the body, leading to bacterial growth adjacent to the opening of the bladder. Cotton underwear for general use is suggested.</p>
</div>
<div>
	These tips can help most women avoid UTIs most of the time. If an infection develops in spite of these precautions, promptly seek medical help.&nbsp;</div>

43,The PSA Test: A Helpful Screening Tool,"Recent reports have caused confusion about PSA screening, an important diagnostic tool for prostate health.","<p>
	Despite considerable evidence supporting the use of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) testing as a screening tool, conflicting statements regarding the appropriateness of PSA screening have been reported recently. This has resulted in confusion among our patients and fellow physicians.</p>
<p>

Various entities mistakenly assume that a patient with an elevated PSA will undergo an indiscriminate prostate biopsy, and a patient with prostate cancer will inevitably undergo treatment. This is not our policy at The Urology Group.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PSA screening facilitates the early detection of prostate cancer, which results in:</span><br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduced risk of being diagnosed with or developing locally advanced an/or metastatic prostate cancer;</span><br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality; prostate cancer-specific mortality has declined by more than 40% in the U.S. since the inception of PSA screening.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A baseline serum PSA level should be obtained from men in their 40s who have made an informed decision to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intervals for an individual&rsquo;s prostate cancer screening should be adapted to:</span><br />

	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prostate cancer risk factors (including African-American heritage and a family history of prostate cancer);</span><br />

<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Routine check ups should be completed through your primary care physician. However, you could be referred to a urologist due to one of the following conditions.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	1. <strong>Abnormal PSA test</strong>: A PSA test screens for prostate cancer by measuring the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. An abnormal or elevated PSA test should receive immediate follow-up.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	2. <strong>Hematuria</strong>: Hematuria means the presence of blood in urine and can be caused by a number of potentially serious conditions including bladder cancer, kidney cancer, urinary tract infections and stones.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	3. <strong>Kidney stones</strong>: A key symptom of kidney stones is severe pain in the lower stomach, side of the back, groin or testicles. Left untreated, stones can wreak havoc on the kidneys and cause permanent, lasting damage.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	4. <strong>Enlarged prostate</strong>: As men age, their prostates tend to grow larger. If the prostate grows too large it puts pressure on the urethra and can obstruct urine flow. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH can cause many symptoms including an urge to urinate often, weak urine flow and pain in the lower back, pelvis or thighs.</p>
<p>
	The other important part of Men&rsquo;s Health Week is simply getting men to talk about their health concerns. If you have questions regarding your urinary or genital tract health, talk to your doctor or schedule an appointment today.</p>

48,Active Surveillance – One of Several Options for Prostate Cancer ,When is no treatment the best option? ,"<div>
	When a patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer, understanding and considering a course of treatment can be overwhelming. As you and your physician consider which treatment may be best for you, it is important to understand how far your cancer has progressed, potential treatment-related side effects and your general health.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	One treatment option that we always consider at The Urology Group is no treatment at all. This is commonly referred to as &ldquo;active surveillance&rdquo; and may be right for some patients.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The &ldquo;active surveillance&rdquo; approach monitors the cancer over time to assess progression rather than intervening immediately with surgery, radiation therapy or other treatments.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Typically, active surveillance can be an option when the prostate cancer is:</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		not causing any symptoms</li>
	<li>
		expected to grow slowly</li>
	<li>
		<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">small and contained within the prostate</span></li>

	This &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach requires regularly scheduled prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests and digital rectal exams (DRE), as well as a repeat biopsy of the prostate at one year, and specific intervals thereafter.</div>

	The profile of a candidate for active surveillance includes a low grade (Gleason 6 or under), low-risk prostate cancer (low PSA and stage) that appears to be low in volume (small amount of cancer found on biopsy, for example). Lifestyle considerations may also be a factor. Researchers are currently developing biomarkers and additional tests to make this decision easier and more accurately informed.</div>

<div>
	Active surveillance might also be a good choice for older men with limited life expectancy. In addition, if a man is currently battling other serious disorders or diseases, such as heart disease, long-standing high blood pressure, or poorly controlled diabetes, it may be best to hold off on therapy and avoid its potential complications.</div>

49,AUA Annual Conference Provides Updates on OAB Treatment,The American Urological Association (AUA) has announced promising results for using Botox for overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms.,"<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/441/Shay_5902.jpg"" style=""width: 125px; height: 188px;"" /></p>
<p>
	The symptoms of an overactive bladder (OAB) &ndash; feeling an urgency to urinate frequently &mdash; are quite common. Most studies indicate that about 15% of the U.S. population experiences OAB, although the percentage increases with age to approximately one-third of elderly individuals.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">In some cases, OAB and urinary incontinence can effectively be treated with Botox injections. The American Urological Association&rsquo;s (AUA) recent annual conference included an encouraging report on the procedure.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><a href=""http://urologytimes.modernmedicine.com/urology-times/news/best-aua-2014-female-urologyincontinenceurodynamics"">The report announced research</a> demonstrating that Botox injections reduced urge incontinence episodes per day at 12 weeks. The effect remained stable at 24 to 36 weeks between each injection cycle. This means that patients can have greater control over longer periods of time.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The procedure itself involves the physician injecting Botox directly into the bladder muscle, partially paralyzing it to reduce over activity &ndash; but leaving enough control to empty the bladder voluntarily. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">OAB can be particularly challenging because for many people, the cause is unknown. However, a patient can adopt lifestyle changes to help control the condition. Cutting down on caffeinated drinks, alcohol, chocolate, tomatoes, citrus and spicy foods has shown positive results. In addition, women with OAB may experience improvement after performing pelvic floor exercises.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">If you are suffering from untreated symptoms of OAB, the first step is to see a physician. While The Urology Group does offer Botox as one of many treatments for OAB, your doctor can evaluate your condition and help you determine if lifestyle changes or a procedure such as a Botox injection would be the best course of action.</span></p>

	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/451/Race post.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Public awareness of prostate cancer continues to increase. In January, the American Cancer Society projected that more cases of prostate cancer than breast cancer would be diagnosed this year. Many national media outlets including CNN, ESPN and the <em>Washington Post</em> have featured significant coverage of the issue.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">As a result, we believe that this year&rsquo;s ZERO Prostate Cancer 10K/5K Event in Cincinnati will be the biggest and best in our history. &nbsp;Our goal is to welcome 1,500 participants to the starting line on Saturday, September 6! If we hit our goal it represents a 25% increase in participation&mdash;another good sign we&rsquo;re increasing awareness.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The Urology Group will host the event for the eighth consecutive year and the course will wind its way through the scenic neighborhoods of Norwood near our office. The area around our office will have a festival atmosphere, complete with food, music and entertainment.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Perhaps most importantly, we&rsquo;ll gather prostate cancer survivors and their caregivers for a special breakfast reception. These individuals will also be recognized at the race and some will have the opportunity to share their stories of persistence and recovery.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">We&rsquo;re also using this event as an opportunity to talk about men&rsquo;s health&ndash;a topic that men have traditionally been reluctant to discuss. We want to spread the word to men&ndash;and the women in their lives&ndash;about the importance of periodic screening and regular check-ups.</span></p>

<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Prostate cancer screening commonly involves two tests:</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- </span><strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Digital rectal exam</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;""> (DRE): A doctor or nurse inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to estimate the size of the prostate and feel for lumps or other abnormalities.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- </span><strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Prostate specific antigen</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;""> (PSA) test: Determined from a blood sample, this measures the amount of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate and as a rule, the higher the PSA level in the blood, the more likely a prostate problem is present. But a high PSA level doesn&rsquo;t always mean cancer. Many factors can affect PSA levels including age, race and certain medications.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The entire process only takes a few minutes and may be mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The benefits, however, are significant: When prostate cancer is caught early, the five-year survival rate is more than 99 percent, according to ZERO &ndash; The End of Prostate Cancer, the national nonprofit dedicated to the cause. The relative 10-year survival rate is 91 percent and 76 percent at 15 years.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Together, the PSA test and DRE provide a good assessment for determining any prostate problems or irregularities &ndash; and can help catch cancer early.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the U.S. Green Building Council&rsquo;s green certification system for the design, construction, maintenance and operations of sustainable buildings. The benefits of LEED include conserving energy, reducing water consumption, improving air quality, and saving money.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">When we began planning our building, our goal was to create a cutting-edge, high performance facility to support our physicians, staff and patients; receiving LEED certification validates our approach while reflecting the thoughtful strategy and hard work that went into creating it.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">From the design phase through construction, our building used a variety of green strategies:</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">

<p>
	Site selection also played a significant role in the certification, with our proximity to retail stores, residential neighborhoods and nearby amenities encouraging walking and decreasing vehicular traffic. Fuel efficient cars and carpool vehicles receive priority parking, while bike racks and shower facilities promote biking to work.</p>

<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">We welcomed a record number of participants: nearly 2,000 runners and walkers, plus hundreds of family members, neighbors and volunteers. Everyone in attendance at our Norwood campus had the opportunity to enjoy music, food and drinks &ndash; and show their support for eliminating prostate cancer.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The Ring of Courage Breakfast has become an annual highlight during Race Day.

54,Molecular Markers Help Assess Prostate Cancer Risk,New testing from The Urology Group identifies molecular markers in prostate biopsy tissues for a clearer picture of the patient’s condition.,"<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/483/Test tubes.jpg"" style=""height: 193px; width: 300px;"" /></p>
<p>
	One of the biggest challenges in diagnosing early stage prostate cancer is properly staging and grading patients to determine the best treatment plan. &nbsp;Current methods such as clinical staging, PSA serum levels and Gleason scores can help but have limitations. Both patients and physicians need more accurate and objective predictors of recurrence of the disease.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">After extensive review, The Urology Group has decided to evaluate two molecular markers on prostate biopsy tissue in certain patient populations. Molecular markers are fragments of DNA that have been identified as indicating certain results in the human body.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Confirm MDx is a molecular marker that helps distinguish patients with a &lsquo;true&rsquo; negative biopsy from those still at risk for undetected cancer. &nbsp;If the Confirm MDx test is negative, the patient has a greater than 90% certainty of not having prostate cancer.&nbsp; The test results are valid for 24 months, so unless something changes clinically, no repeat biopsy will be needed for two years.&nbsp; If positive, the patient will have another biopsy and about 50% of those patients will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The Confirm MDx test helps keep men without prostate cancer from undergoing unnecessary additional biopsies and identifies high-risk patients who may require repeat biopsies and potential treatment.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Patients with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer&mdash;and their physicians&mdash;need to know how aggressive the disease is. The second molecular marker, Oncotype DX, helps with that determination. The analysis looks at various pathways to evaluate how quickly the cancer has been growing. The test builds on traditional clinical and pathologic factors to provide additional, clinically relevant insight.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The Oncotype DX assay results provide an individualized risk assessment that can help a patient and his physician make a confident choice between active surveillance (watchful waiting) and immediate treatment.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Together, these two molecular markers may help provide a clearer picture of a patient&rsquo;s condition and help his health care team make better patient-specific recommendations for his health and well-being.</span></p>

55,The ABCs of BPH,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlargement of the prostate, is a common condition in men over age 40. But what does it mean?","<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/485/Williams_5916.jpg"" style=""height: 188px; width: 125px;"" /></p>
<p>
	Since September is National Prostate Health Awareness Month, it&rsquo;s appropriate to discuss a common issue: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is an enlargement of the prostate and a common condition in men over age 40.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Some patients mistakenly believe than an enlarged prostate indicates prostate cancer, but hyperplasia simply means an overgrowth of cells. Although BPH can cause uncomfortable symptoms, it usually doesn&rsquo;t pose a dangerous health threat.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">In fact, BPH may not exhibit any symptoms but be detected during a routine exam. Conversely, patients may notice symptoms such as:</span></p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more urgent and frequent need to urinate</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening at night to urinate</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straining during urination</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficulty starting urination and/or a start-and-stop flow</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decreased volume and force of urine stream</p>
<p>
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling the need to continue urinating, despite the flow having stopped</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">BPH has no known cause, although heredity may be a factor. Current research is looking into changes in hormone levels which occur with age.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Because tolerance for discomfort differs with each individual, patients have numerous options to discuss with their physicians. In many cases, no treatment at all is the best alternative, since mild symptoms can clear up or remain stable without intervention.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Studies show that about 40% of men with mild symptoms improve without treatment, 45% continue with no change, and only 15% worsen. Regular checkups can keep tabs on the individual situation.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">BPH requires treatment if the patient finds the symptoms excessively bothersome or debilitating. In some cases, urinary flow can be blocked which is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">There are no preventive measures for BPH, although some lifestyle changes can help manage mild cases. Avoiding certain medications like tranquilizers, decongestants and antihistamines can help. Reducing fluid intake in the evenings will decrease the possibility of having to urinate during the night, as well as limiting caffeinated drinks, which are diuretics.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Individuals experiencing urinary difficulties should consult with a physician. Whether or not BPH is diagnosed, a doctor can provide recommendations and help determine a course of action to address the condition.</span></p>

	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/554/Buff2.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 300px;"" /></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Kidney stones have a well-deserved reputation for being an extremely painful condition. Those who have experienced kidney stones know that relief can&rsquo;t come fast enough.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">With March being National Kidney Month, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to turn the spotlight on a recent addition to The Urology Group that helps patients feel better faster: lithotripsy with ultrasound.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Lithotripsy (also called extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy, or ESWL) uses high-energy shock waves to break kidney stones into tiny pieces, making them small enough to pass through the urinary tract and out of the body. The Urology Group performs more of these procedures than any other location in the country.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">We now have a truly unique advantage: ultrasound technology &lsquo;built in&rsquo; to the lithotripsy equipment. The Urology Group is the only provider in the nation to offer this effective combination. By adding ultrasound to the lithotripsy procedure:</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the type and location of kidney stones are more easily pinpointed;</span></p>
<p>
	-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patient alignment with the equipment can be adjusted to better target stones and minimize the impact on surrounding tissue;</p>
<p>
	-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; physicians and technicians can better monitor the progress of the procedure.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">As a result, the stone breakage rate improves and patients can begin feeling better sooner. They also have the assurance of knowing that our technicians work with more lithotripsy patients than anyone in the country and have a wealth of experience and expertise.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">One in 10 people will experience kidney stones at some point in their lives, according to the National Kidney Foundation. With the number of patients we treat, we believe it&rsquo;s important for both their comfort and well being to use ultrasound for the procedure &ndash; which ultimately gets them feeling better faster.</span></p>

<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">New and improving medical technology continues to create options for patients suffering from prostate issues.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">One such solution is holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), a minimally invasive treatment for an enlarged prostate (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). A common condition in men over age 40, BPH is an overgrowth of cells in the tissue surrounding the prostate that restricts its expansion, causing it to press against the urethra and impede urination.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">HoLEP is specialized for patients with significantly enlarged prostates, typically more than 50 grams in size, and offers these advantages:</span></p>
<p>
	-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less invasive than more traditional methods;<br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a low risk procedure;</span><br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits will endure, and studies show excellent short and long-term outcomes;</span><br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chance of subsequent erectile dysfunction is reduced;</span><br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides early, immediate symptom relief and a fast return to normal activity.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">During HoLEP, a laser precisely removes the obstructing portion of the prostate, similar to open surgery but without the need for incisions. With the patient under general anesthesia, the entire portion of the prostate gland that&rsquo;s blocking urine flow is removed. HoLEP is an in-hospital procedure with an overnight stay typically necessary.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">In addition to immediately improving urinary symptoms, studies show HoLEP provides a lasting solution because there is nothing to grow back following the procedure.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">As the only physician in greater Cincinnati with the training to perform the HoLEP procedure, I can speak to the benefits that it has provided my patients. It was my privilege to be trained by Dr. James Lingeman, who pioneered the procedure in U.S.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">While HoLEP can be an effective alternative, it is not suitable for every situation. Patients with prostate issues should schedule a consultation with a urologist to determine treatment options and a plan.</span></p>

60,Focus on Female Urology: Statistics That May Surprise You,"For their overall health, women should be aware of their gender-specific urologic conditions. ","<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/41/Shay.png"" style=""width: 233px; height: 214px;"" /></p>
<p>
	Many urological problems affect both men <u>and</u> women, such as kidney stones, urinary tract infections and certain types of cancer. However, the physiological differences between men&#39;s and women&#39;s urinary tracts mean that some conditions are gender-specific and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>
	National Women&#39;s Health Week, from May 10-16, serves as an opportunity to raise awareness of female urologic issues and encourage women to take steps to improve their health.</p>
<p>
	You may be surprised at some of the statistics:</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>- Bladder cancer</strong></em>: more than 18,000 women were diagnosed in 2014. Though it&#39;s less common in women than men, women have a worse prognosis and lower survival rate - which highlights the importance of early detection through regular check-ups.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>- Interstitial Cystitis (IC)</strong></em>: an estimated 3.3 million women suffer from IC, also known as painful bladder syndrome. Because IC likely has several different causes, no single approach works for everyone - meaning individual treatment based on personal consultation is necessary.</p>

	<em><strong>- Incontinence</strong></em>: women experience the involuntary loss of urine control about twice as often as men. And one in three women experiences stress incontinence - the involuntary leaking of urine when coughing, sneezing, laughing or just walking. Incontinence or symptoms of overactive bladder can adversely affect daily life but are typically treatable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	For women, these conditions can be exacerbated as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, menopause or a hysterectomy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Urology Group is proud to have three physicians who are certified in Female Pelvic Medicine &amp; Reconstructive Surgery. This specialization gives us better insight to female urology conditions, leading to better patient care.</p>
<p>
	If you are experiencing problems, consult with a physician; it&#39;s also important to monitor your health with routine wellness appointments.</p>

63,The Pathology Lab: Supporting Patient Care Behind the Scenes,Patients rarely see where an important part of their care takes place.,"<p>
	At The Urology Group, an important part of patient care happens in a place that patients rarely see: the pathology lab.</p>
<p>
	Physicians order biopsies, urinalyses or blood tests to confirm their observations or to learn more about a patient&#39;s condition. The results allow physicians to more accurately assess the patient and determine the appropriate steps for treatment.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/586/Lab.magnify.petri.jpg"" style=""float: left;"" />At The Urology Group, we have the only in-house lab in the Greater Cincinnati area dedicated to urologic and prosate tissue analysis and biopsies. The lab plays an important role in patient care - even though it&#39;s typically behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As a patient, you can trust the performance of our lab, because we:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Hold accreditation from the College of American Pathologists, having passed an intense inspection that checks hundreds of items.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Review approximately 2,500 prostate biopsies each year - more than any other lab in the region - giving us a tremendous depth of experience and the ability to identify issues quickly.</li>
	<li>
		Serve as the only provider in the region of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analysis, a sophisticated test that is key to addressing recurrent bladder cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Most importantly, we provide fast, accurate results, which means patients and their families spend less time waiting anxiously for news. For physicians and staff, quicker test results mean they get a faster start on evaluating treatment options and determining the best course of action with patients.</p>
<p>
	The lab serves as a partner in the multi-disciplinary team approach to patient care, working with physicians, specialists, nurses and staff to create an optimal treatment plan.</p>
<p>
	We&#39;re proud of our achievements to date, which position us as a healthcare leader with a growing national reputation. We remain committed to the highest standards in the industry, to provide the highest quality patient care.</p>

64,A Wake-Up Call Regarding Prostate Cancer,Recent reports are alarming: fewer men are getting tested for prostate cancer. ,"<p>
	A recent report provided a startling wake-up call: more men are currently in danger of dying from preventable prostate cancer.</p>
<p>
	Over the past few years, conflicting statements regarding the appropriateness of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests have been reported, generating confusion among both patients and physicians. As a result, far fewer men are getting screened, resulting in some eye-opening statistics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		the overall rate of PSA testing has dropped 50%;</li>
	<li>
		the largest decline is among men aged 50-70, the group most likely to benefit from testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The simple truth is, early detection means more options for treatment and an increased chance of survival:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		prior to the development of PSA testing, 20 to 25% of men presented to doctors with cancer already spreading in their bodies; with PSA testing, that has dropped to 4%;</li>
	<li>
		with PSA screening, U.S. men achieved a 45% reduction in mortality in prostate cancer, versus an increase in mortality worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	At The Urology Group, we made our position clear with a statement you can read <a href=""/blog/2014/05/16/the-psa-test-a-helpful-screening-tool/"">here</a>. With Father&#39;s Day as well as Men&#39;s Health Month being recognized in June, we&#39;re taking the opportunity to continue raising awareness of the importance of testing for prostate cancer, the second most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the U.S.</p>
<p>
	We encourage men to see their physicians, discuss their risk factors and when appropriate, get checked for prostate cancer. We hope that families and friends support them in taking that preventive step for early detection.</p>

65,Don't Procrastinate with Pelvic Pain,Recurring pain in the pelvis or bladder can be a sign of Interstitial Cystitis.,"<p>
	If you have recurring pain in your pelvis or bladder, you probably don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;interstitial cystitis.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a long name for a condition that can be difficult to diagnose because it can have multiple, interrelated causes.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Interstitial cystitis, or &ldquo;IC,&rdquo; is a chronic health issue in which patients feel pain or pressure in the bladder area. An estimated 4 million people in the U.S. suffer from IC, approximately 80 percent of them female.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Several different conditions &ndash; or combinations of conditions &ndash; can cause IC. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to consult with your physician if you&rsquo;re experiencing pelvic pain. A proper diagnosis may require time and you don&rsquo;t want to suffer any longer than necessary.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">To further complicate the diagnosis, symptoms range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Any of the following could indicate IC:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Pain ranging from &lsquo;nagging&rsquo; to &lsquo;intense&rsquo; in the bladder and surrounding pelvic region</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">A sense of urgency and/or increased frequency of urination</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Pain that worsens during menstruation</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Painful sexual intercourse for women</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Pain or discomfort in the scrotum or penis</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">For many, IC feels like a bladder infection, though antibiotics make no impact because there&rsquo;s no infection to treat. The exact cause of pain with IC is actually not clear, but several theories exist. These range from an allergic response to autoimmune reaction to an excessive inflammatory response to even the slightest stimulus which would not generally be perceived as painful in a patient who does not have IC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">IC can frustrate patients because besides a challenging diagnosis, not everyone responds the same way to the same treatment. In addition, IC treatments can take several weeks to several months to provide relief.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.0240001678467px; line-height: 1.6em;"">If you suffer from pelvic pain, begin with an open discussion with your physician. Whether or not you are diagnosed with IC, you can start to work toward solutions to your condition. Treatment options, such as pharmaceuticals, nerve stimulations or surgery can be evaluated and your doctor can help you decide on the appropriate approach for you.</span></p>

56,Dispelling Myths about a Leaky Bladder,Don't believe the myths about urinary leakage.,"<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/619/Edwards_214x214_Rounded.png"" /></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">For those who suffer from a leaky bladder or urinary incontinence, the symptoms may be difficult to discuss. Simple embarrassment may discourage individuals from expressing concerns with family members or medical professionals.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">As a result, many people mistakenly believe the myths regarding urinary leakage. Here are some common incorrect assumptions, followed by the facts.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- &ldquo;If you have bladder problems, you shouldn&rsquo;t exercise.&rdquo;</span><br />
	<strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Not true</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">. Exercise plays a major role in overall health and weight control.&nbsp; Excessive body weight is a risk factor for bladder leaks, and in fact makes symptoms worse. Workout routines can be modified to avoid high-impact activities such as running and jumping that can put extra strain and pressure on the bladder.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- &ldquo;Drinking too much water increases your chances of overactive bladder.&rdquo;</span><br />
	<strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">False</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">. People may significantly limit their water intake thinking that it will control incontinence. In reality, restricting fluids can lead to dehydration and constipation &ndash; which can actually bring about or worsen bladder leaks. A smarter approach is to consume smaller amounts throughout the day instead of drinking big glasses a few times.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- &ldquo;Incontinence is just part of getting old.&rdquo;</span><br />
	<strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Not necessarily</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">. For women, the decrease of estrogen that occurs during menopause may affect bladder control, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean urinary leakage is inevitable after a certain age. The muscles of the pelvic floor can be strengthened like other muscles; physicians can provide guidance for appropriate exercises.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">- &ldquo;You just have to live with it.&rdquo;</span><br />
	<strong style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Definitely not</strong><span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">. Waiting to seek treatment prolongs discomfort and may worsen the condition. In most cases, urinary incontinence can be greatly reduced or eliminated through options such as behavioral therapies, medications or in some cases, surgery.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">For some, symptoms of incontinence increase only gradually, leading patients to procrastinate and suffer longer than they have to. Seeking treatment when incontinence is mild can prevent both discomfort and embarrassment, so speak with your urologist about any concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>

67,Clinical Trials: What Patients Need to Know,Clinical trials are a crucial tool for research. Patients considering participation should start with these basic facts. ,"<p>
	Without research, there would be no progress in health care. That&#39;s why clinical trials play such an important role in collecting crucial data about new drugs, devices and treatments.</p>
<p>
	Physicians may recommend patients for clinical trials, or patients may seek out opportunities and volunteer. Regardless, patients typically have common questions about participating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Patients can expect a thorough discussion and personal evaluation prior to a clinical trial, but here&#39;s some basic information that patients need to know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Patients and their responses are closely monitored.</strong> Clinical trials have to meet specific criteria for patient safety, informed consent, ethical conduct and other aspects of research and must be approved by an institutional review board. With nearly 20 years of experience in conducting clinical research, The Urology Group has an established track record of working with patients and medical professionals to obtain beneficial results.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Sponsors of the studies usually cover the costs associated with participation. </strong>The pharmaceutical or biotechnolgy companies that sponsor clinical research generally assume program costs such as bloodwork, imaging and consultations. However, patients should confirm with the study coordinator prior to enrolling, as insurance coverage and study details can differ.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Patient confidentiality is protected. </strong>In accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the patient&#39;s informed consent agreement ensures not only confidentiality of individual health records but information such as name, medical record numbers and zip codes.

68,Seven Questions Men Should Ask About Prostate Cancer,"September is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, so here are 7 questions to jump-start a discussion with your urologist.","<p>
	September serves as Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, putting the spotlight on the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the second-leading cause of cancer death in men (behind only lung cancer).</p>
<p>
	According to the American Cancer Society, there will be approximately 233,000 new cases of prostate cancer and an estimated 29,480 deaths in the United States during 2015.</p>
<p>
	The first and most important step is for men to have a conversation with their urologists. To encourage that interaction and establish a dialogue, patients can start with the following list: &quot;Seven Questions Every Man Should Ask His Urologist About Prostate Cancer.&quot;</p>
<p>
	7) &quot;Is my family history important? What hereditary factors are significant?&quot;</p>
<p>
	6) &quot;Does race matter? Are certain population segments more at risk than others?&quot;</p>
<p>
	5) &quot;According to the government, I don&#39;t need to be screened for prostate cancer. Do I even need to take a PSA (prostate specific antigen) test?&quot;</p>
<p>
	4) &quot;What other tests, if any, should I consider?&quot;</p>
<p>
	3) &quot;I&#39;ve heard you can live with prostate cancer. If I have it, do I need to be treated?&quot;</p>
<p>
	2) &quot;What about diet? Are there any foods to absolutely eat or absolutely avoid eating?&quot;</p>
<p>
	1) &quot;I hear about progress in the field of genetics. Are genetics advancements helping in the treatment of prostate cancer?&quot;</p>
<p>
	Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is the perfect time to increase public understanding of the disease, including its prevalence, the approaches to screening and prevention, treatment options and patient resources.</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s also the perfect time for men to have a candid conversation with their urologists. Find out more about prostate cancer <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/conditions-we-treat/prostate-cancer/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

69,Our Prostate Cancer Fight in the National Spotlight,A successful ZERO Prostate Cancer Race brings national attention to our region.,"<p>
	<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The national spotlight in the fight against prostate cancer shone in our neighborhood this weekend. On Saturday, Sept. 12, The Urology Group hosted the second largest ZERO Prostate Cancer 10k/5k event in the country with more than 1,500 participants convening at our Norwood Campus.</span></p>
<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/669/Charles_on_stage.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 357px; float: left;"" />Rising country star Jimmy Charles performed his new song, &quot;Superman,&quot; prior to the start of the Race. Jimmy wrote the song afer meeting prostate cancer survivors and currently serves as the national spokesperson for ZERO Prostate Cancer. A former American Idol finalist, Jimmy recorded <a href=""http://www.cmt.com/videos/jimmy-charles/1235008/superman.jhtml"">a music video that launched on CMT</a> (Country Music Television) earlier this month.</p>
<p>
	The prostate cancer Survivors&#39; Breakfast, hosted by FOX19 Morning News anchor Rob Williams, served as an inspirational highlight of the day. The event welcomes cancer survivors and their caregivers from across the region, saluting their strength and courage during their cancer fight. This annual event gives survivors a chance to get caught up with one another, sharing stories and insights from their experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The weather cooperated with cool temperatures for the Race itself, allowing many runners to finish with competitive times. For others, simply finishing the Race was an achievement, and they too received applause and hugs from their supporters.</p>
<p>
	As we work to finalize the grand totals, we know that this year&#39;s Race will contribute more than $100,000 to ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer. In addition to our runners, we have many sponsors, both local and national, to thank for their assistance.</p>
<p>
	On behalf of the physicians and staff of The Urology Group, many of whom were deeply involved and devoted countless hours to this event, I&#39;d like to thank our community for supporting this important cause in men&#39;s health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And finally - congratulations to everyone who helped us deliver a great performance in the national spotlight!</p>

	It&#39;s nearly Movember - when the razors get put away and the mustache combs come out of hiding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 12px;""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/683/MovemberIconBlog.png"" style=""width: 350px; height: 130px; float: left;"" /></span>We at The Urology Group are proud to recognize Movember, the annual month-long event with the goal of &#39;changing the face&#39; of men&#39;s health, particularly regarding prostate and testicular cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Gender is one of the most consistent predictors of health and life expectancy. For men, this is not good news given that, on average, we die six years earlier than women. Among other health issues, the impact of prostate and testicular cancer is significant, with prostate cancer being the most common non-skin cancer in men worldwide and the number of cases expected to almost double to 1.7 million cases by 2030. About 1 man in 7 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime.</p>
<p>
	To show our support and raise awareness of men&#39;s health issues, some of our own physicians are joining men around the world by growing mustaches during the month of November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Personally, I&#39;m excited to give the razor a break, and I invite all of you to join the effort to raise awareness with my fellow physicians by participating in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Grow your Mo. By growing facial hair we raise funds and awareness for men&#39;s health, specifically prostate cancer. On Movember 1, start with a clean-shaven face and then let it grow. Feel free to groom, trim and style your way to facial hair supremacy.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		For the women, and those men with hypogonadism, show your support by offering high praise to those braving an itchy face for charity.</li>
	<li>
		Officially join our Movember team by <a href=""http://moteam.co/the-urology-group-cincinnati"">signing up here</a> and encouraging your friends and family to do the same.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Attend the Movember Kick-Off and Shave-Off events. Join us for some BLUE beer, snacks and a chance to win some great door prizes.</li>

66,An Easy Way to Make a Difference,Help fight prostate cancer by participating in the 2015 ZERO Prostate Cancer race!,"<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/628/Race.runner.cheering.jpg"" style=""width: 144px; height: 250px; float: left;"" />Nine years ago, two nurses working in the surgery center of The Urology Group had an idea. Having seen the challenges of a prostate cancer diagnosis, they wanted to raise awareness of the disease and find a way to help patients and their families.</p>
<p>
	From that inspiration, our organization began sponsoring and hosting an annual race for prostate cancer. At that first event in 2007, we had about 100 runners. This year&#39;s ZERO Prostate Cancer 10k/5k on Saturday, September 12, will feature more than 1,500 participants, along with hundreds of volunteers, visitors and spectators.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/630/Race.survivor.hats.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 168px; float: right;"" /></p>
<p>
	Every year, one of the event&#39;s highlights is the recognition of the prostate cancer survivors in attendance. It&#39;s always inspiring to see the courage and determination of these men, many of whom are battling the disease with the full support of family members, loved ones, friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the tireless efforts of our race board and volunteers, it&#39;s easy for you to participate and make a difference in the lives of prostate cancer patients - and those who have yet to be diagnosed.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/629/Race.family.sign.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 192px; float: left;"" />You have many options to show your support. If you&#39;re a runner, run.

114,Help Your Bladder Survive the Holidays: 7 Balancing Acts ,How to help your bladder survive over the holiday season,"<div>
	Before accepting that fourth holiday-party cocktail, consider what it will do to your New Year&rsquo;s bladder.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/1040/Minnillo_web.png"" style=""margin: 2px; width: 175px; height: 175px; float: right;"" /></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Your bladder is storing those drinks like a plastic bag in a box of wine before reaching capacity<br />
	and hitting the &ldquo;release&rdquo; button. The contents might be all gone tomorrow, but reminders of their temporary residence could linger well into 2019.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<br />
	Alcohol is among a list of holiday delights that can overwhelm the already hard-working bladder, from rich foods to hugging outfits to caffeine. All day long the bladder does its job of taking in fluid, expanding to capacity, and then releasing it. But between those releases, it&rsquo;s storing<br />
	whatever all that fluid contains. And that can be taxing.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	We&rsquo;re not Scrooges here &mdash; we encourage festivities during the holidays. But we&rsquo;re also big fans<br />
	of a healthy 2019, and a few painless guidelines will help ensure it as you navigate the<br />
	over-indulging events that have come to define the holiday season. And we promise, you can even over-indulge a little, too.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	Following are seven simple compromises for a healthy bladder over the holiday season.</div>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Alternate cocktails with water.</strong> Alcohol increases the production of urine, causing your body to release water faster and more frequently. This can lead to dehydration. A shortage of fluids in your system can result in a buildup of body waste in the urine, which can irritate the bladder, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/in-depth/bladder-control-problem/art-20046597"" target=""_blank"">the Mayo Clinic reports</a>.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Avoid tobacco smoke. </strong>Not much to add here. Cigarette smoking causes more than half of the bladder cancers in the U.S., <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bladder-cancer-smokers/most-smokers-with-bladder-cancer-know-tobacco-was-the-cause-idUSKCN0IV1S920141111"" target=""_blank"">a study by Kaiser Permanente</a> reports. More than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer are <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/bladder-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"" target=""_blank"">estimated to be diagnosed</a> in 2018. Fortunately, bladder cancer is highly curable &ndash; there&rsquo;s a <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/bladder-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"" target=""_blank"">77% survival rate</a> in the first five years.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Eat the cookies, but also eat salad (avoiding romaine this year). </strong>The rich foods that make the holidays so special might cling to your digestive system as well as your midsection. Constipation is a leading <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/kidney_and_urinary_system_disorders/bladder_and_bowel_dysfunction_134,113"" target=""_blank"">contributor to bladder incontinence</a>, which could really interfere with mistletoe magic. Balance out sugary, high-fat cheeses, dips and desserts with fiber-rich holiday foods. Options include whole grain crackers, raw veggies and fruits, sweet potato pie, chocolate-covered strawberries and certain nuts, such as almonds. If you&#39;re going for salad this year, keep in mind the recent recall on romaine lettuce. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2018/o157h7-11-18/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Read more here.</a></li>
	<li>
		<strong>Be a restroom regular.</strong> Another simple way to prevent constipation is by drinking plenty of caffeine-free and alcohol-free fluids, but be sure to use the bathroom when you need to. If you hold it in and wait until the last minute, your bladder may not empty completely and the residual urine, if left in the bladder too long, can contribute to a bladder and/or urinary tract infection.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Make decaf the (occasional) new black.</strong> Caffeine, like alcohol, is a diuretic, which <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/in-depth/bladder-control-problem/art-20046597"" target=""_blank"">causes the body to produce more urine</a> while stimulating the urgency to pee. This can exacerbate the compromised function of an overactive bladder, a leading cause of urinary incontinence. Request (or offer) decaffeinated after-dinner coffee drinks. Note that dark chocolate, plentiful on the holidays, also contains caffeine. If given a choice, opt for white chocolate.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Wear that awesome outfit, but wear it well. </strong>You should look great during the holidays, but also be comfortable and mindful of future comfort. Tight-fitting pants, pantyhose and nylon underwear can trap moisture while keeping you warm, which is an environment that breeding bacteria love. And bacteria, when grown in the urine, cause urinary tract infections (UTIs).</li>
	<li>
		<strong>About that mistletoe. </strong>Holiday romance can haunt you if it results in a UTI. This occurs when the urethra, the tube through which urine escapes the bladder, comes into contact with bacteria in a partner&rsquo;s genitals. In women, who have shorter urethras, the risks of contracting UTIs are greater. Cleaning and urinating before and after sex reduces the chances.</li>
</ol>
<div>
	Follow these tips and compromises as often as you can and it should help your hard-working bladder tackle 2019 with better energy and health. Remember, you may have lots of opportunities to celebrate, but your bladder never gets a day off.</div>

112,First-Class Race for Prostate Cancer,Belterra Park Cincinnati - the perfect backdrop for our 11th prostate cancer run,"<p>
	The Urology Group completed another first, this time in the form of one of the most unique running experiences in Greater Cincinnati&rsquo;s history. On Saturday, September 22, we hosted The Gentlemen Stakes 5K, our 11th prostate cancer run to benefit ZERO &ndash; The End of Prostate Cancer.</p>
<p>
	More than 1,000 runners, walkers and spectators gathered to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer. What made this year so unusual? It was the amazing venue. This year we partnered with Belterra Park Cincinnati to deliver a spectacular running event, starting and finishing right on the horse track. The course, just over 24 furlongs (or 5K if you prefer) passed through Riverbend Music Center, wound through Coney Island and finished back at Belterra.</p>
<p>
	In total, the event raised nearly $120,000. Just as important, it got men talking about their health. Survivors Marcus Brooks, Rob Cooper and Steve Newsome, Sr. shared a few words before the race about their cancer journeys while hundreds of other survivors talked throughout the day about their experiences.</p>
<p>
	We would like to thank key companies who sponsored the event, many of whom support use year after year.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Abbvie &ndash; our national premier sponsor</li>
	<li>
		Richard Wolf Co. &ndash; our local presenting sponsor</li>

		Mercy Health Foundation &ndash; our Survivor Breakfast sponsor</li>
	<li>
		Mercedes Benz of Ft. Mitchell and the Wyler Family Foundation &ndash; our Winner&rsquo;s Circle sponsor</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We would also like to thank our good friends at Belterra Park Cincinnati for opening their doors to us and generously donating food for the breakfast, team support and many, many other logistics.<br />
	Thanks also to our dedicated employees who gave countless volunteer hours to create a memorable event. We could not do this race without them.</p>

74,Younger Men More Frequently Diagnosed with Testicular Cancer ,"Since April is national Testicular Cancer Awareness Month, it’s an opportunity to highlight some key information about this disease.","<p>
	Although it&rsquo;s less common than other types of cancer, testicular cancer differs in a significant way: a man&rsquo;s average age at the time of diagnosis is much younger &ndash; age 33.&nbsp; Compare that to the average age when prostate cancer is diagnosed, which is 66, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that few men even think about testicular cancer.<br />
	<br />
	Since April is national Testicular Cancer Awareness Month, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to highlight some key information about this disease.<br />
	<br />
	Though the overall mortality risk is low &ndash; about one in 5,000 &ndash; risk factors can vary. Men with an increased chance of developing testicular cancer (such as a family history) should consult with a physician. Left untreated, the disease can develop into more serious and potentially deadly issues in other parts of the body.<br />
	<br />
	Starting around age 25, men in higher-risk groups can perform a monthly self-examination, typically in the shower when the skin of the scrotum is relaxed. Holding a testicle between the thumb and fingers, men should gently roll it to feel for any hard lumps or nodules, or any change in the size, shape or consistency.<br />
	<br />
	Too often men wait to seek evaluation after they have noticed a change on self exam, feeling too nervous, anxious or embarrassed&nbsp; to seek treatment.&nbsp; Men should know that this is a very treatable condition if caught early. Don&rsquo;t delay seeking treatment if you notice a change on self exam.<br />
	<br />
	If you&rsquo;re unsure of your risk factors, schedule an appointment with your urologist, who can provide additional guidance and support.</p>

73,‘Robotic Surgery’ Has the Human Touch,"Robotic surgery provides a high tech treatment alternative for many conditions, including prostate, kidney and bladder cancers as well as pelvic prolapse for women. ","<p>
	For some patients, the term &ldquo;robotic surgery&rdquo; may still bring to mind images more like science fiction than medicine. In reality, it&rsquo;s become a common practice, with the number of &ldquo;robotics assisted&rdquo; surgeries nationwide exceeding 400,000 last year and continuing to increase annually, according to industry statistics.</p>
<p>
	To put a particular misconception to rest: a robot does not perform the surgery. Rather, the surgeon performs the procedure with miniaturized instruments, guiding the robotic arms using a magnified three-dimensional image of the surgical field. The system replicates the surgeon&#39;s movements in real time.</p>
<p>
	Robotic surgery provides a high tech treatment alternative for many conditions, including prostate, kidney and bladder cancers as well as pelvic prolapse for women.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		For the patient, the use of robotic technology offers significant advantages, such as:</li>
	<li>
		Less pain and discomfort, because the process is less invasive and uses smaller incisions;</li>
	<li>
		Reduced risk of infection and less bleeding, due to the ability to make smaller, more precise incisions;</li>
	<li>
		Minimal scarring and better cosmetic results, since less damage is done to skin and tissue;</li>
	<li>
		Faster recovery time and shortened hospital stays, because of the reduced impact on the body, allowing patients to return to normal activities quicker than they would with open surgery.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Among medical specialties, urology embraced the possibilities of robotic surgery very early and as a result, remains on the leading edge of technology. Physicians at The Urology Group have performed thousands of robotic procedures and have developed a reputation as national leaders in the technology.</p>
<p>
	Robotic surgery will continue to become more prevalent as a treatment option. With the expertise the physicians at The Urology Group have built, patients who need surgery can have confidence that this high tech procedure will feature the human touch.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 13px;"">
	<span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">A common issue women are ashamed to discuss is urinary incontinence.

<p style=""font-size: 13px;"">
	<span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">Patients are even more hesitant to discuss fecal incontinence. It&#39;s hard enough to discuss urine leakage, but when it comes to bowel leakage, most people are mortified! &nbsp;Knowing you suffer from one or both of these issues allows the physician to determine the best treatment. For example, Interstim, a treatment option for urge urinary incontinence, is also a treatment for fecal incontinence. If a patient discloses she has both conditions, the doctor is more likely to suggest Interstim as a therapy early on. &nbsp;On the other hand, if a patient doesn&#39;t mention fecal incontinence due to embarrassment, Interstim may not be offered unless other less invasive therapies have failed to address urinary incontinence.</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13px;"">
	<span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">Honest and direct communication benefits both the patient and the physician. Talking about urological issues can be embarrassing but patients need to know they are not alone. Millions of women suffer from urinary incontinence and it&rsquo;s unlikely that any embarrassing issue you may be facing is something your physician hasn&rsquo;t dealt with before.</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13px;"">
	<span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">To help facilitate the conversation, I would encourage patients to write down symptoms before their visit. &nbsp;We also provide a bladder diary on our website that patients can fill out prior to their appointments. &nbsp;That can really help urologists understand the severity of the problem. &nbsp;It can also help patients better understand the problem so they have an easier time describing their symptoms. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13px;"">
	<span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:12px;"">If there is one person with whom you shouldn&rsquo;t be timid or bashful, it is your doctor. Sharing the details &ndash; even the embarrassing ones &ndash; allows for more specific treatment options, can eliminate unnecessary procedures and could just save your life.</span></span></p>

75,Why Men Should be Concerned about The Zika Virus,"There’s a dangerous misconception that only pregnant women need to be concerned about Zika, but Zika is a men’s issue as well.","<p>
	June kicks off the vacation season during which thousands of Cincinnati-area families and singles will flock to southern beaches in Florida, Texas, Mexico and the Caribbean, places where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/health/zika-what-you-need-to-know/index.html"">The mosquito-borne virus has prompted worldwide concern</a> because of a link to a birth defect and its rapid spread.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s a dangerous misconception that only pregnant women need to be concerned about Zika, but Zika is a men&rsquo;s issue as well. So long as a woman isn&#39;t pregnant when she&#39;s when infected, or doesn&#39;t get pregnant shortly afterward, she doesn&#39;t run the risk of a mosquito bite leading to a Zika-related birth defect. However, Zika has been found in the semen of infected men &ndash; and it&#39;s unknown how long it stays there and over what period of time a man can transmit the virus through sex. Reproductively speaking, men &ndash; not women &ndash; have the most reason for concern after coming in contact with the Zika virus.</p>
<p>
	The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made it an official guidance on Zika that men showing any symptoms should wait six months before having unprotected sex.</p>
<p>
	While a blood test can determine if a person is infected with the virus, Zika can persist in semen for at least two months after a man becomes infected. This means that a man who has recovered from Zika could still pass the virus to a sexual partner. Currently there is no test to check men&rsquo;s sperm for the virus.</p>
<p>
	While all domestic cases of Zika so far have been associated with travel, health officials are warning that the mosquitos carrying the virus will soon start biting and infecting U.S. residents.</p>
<p>
	The introduction of virus-carrying mosquitoes to the U.S. makes it all the more important that men take precautions with their sexual health. Men who have been exposed to the Zika virus or feel they may have been exposed should use condoms when having sexual relations or avoid sex all together.</p>

28,Some Lesser-Known Causes of Male Infertility,Dr. Haaff discusses some avoidable causes of male infertility.,"<p>
	<img alt=""Infertility"" class=""left"" src=""/Media/345/BlogInfertility.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Every year, one in six couples will struggle with infertility.</p>
<p>
	At The Urology Group, we define infertility as being unable to conceive after one year of regular, unprotected intercourse. The good news is only 1 to 2 percent of couples deemed infertile are actually sterile, and half of those who seek help can eventually bear a child.</p>
<p>
	Male-related problems account for 30 to 50 percent of infertility cases. Though most commonly caused by sperm disorders such as low sperm count, male infertility can also result from several diseases, lifestyle choices and environmental factors. Some of the least-talked about causes of male infertility are often some of the most avoidable. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Mumps</strong></p>
<p>
	One side effect of mumps, seen in roughly 20 percent of patients with the virus, is inflamed testes. The swelling can lead to fertility issues if damage to sperm-producing cells occurs. Infertility from mumps is preventable with responsible vaccination.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Marijuana</strong></p>
<p>
	<a href=""http://men.webmd.com/news/20031013/smoking-marijuana-lowers-fertility"">Studies</a> have shown that repeated use of the recreational drug can deplete sperm count and might also negatively affect sperm quality, both of which can cause infertility. Smoking cigarettes can also lead to decreased fertility.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Stress</strong></p>
<p>
	Severe emotional stress can wreak havoc on sperm count not to mention one&rsquo;s overall health. Elevated stress levels have been shown to interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Celiac disease</strong></p>
<p>
	Undiagnosed, the digestive disorder characterized by gluten sensitivity can negatively affect male fertility. <a href=""https://www.verywell.com/celiac-disease-may-be-linked-to-male-infertility-562620"">Studies</a> have shown that sperm characteristics and hormone levels improved after men adopted gluten-free diets.</p>
<p>
	Couples concerned about their ability to conceive should visit their physicians. I recommend that the male partner of the infertile couple be evaluated first because testing is often less invasive and easier for men than women.</p>
<p>
	One in six may sound like a fairly high number, but even if you are diagnosed as infertile, it does not mean you must face a life without children. There are several treatments, from medicine to surgery, that can help in adding a little one to your life. Your doctor can advise on the best options for you.</p>

76,The Importance of Urology to Women's Health,"Though women can be reluctant to talk about these sensitive issues, it is important to share details with and seek treatment from a certified urologist. Not doing so not only diminishes your quality of life, but can put you at serious risk.","<p>
	Many people are surprised to learn that urology covers a wide range of conditions for both men and women. In addition to treating the male reproductive system, urologists treat diseases and conditions in the kidneys, bladder, and urinary tract &ndash; all of which affect both genders in all stages of life.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Women may experience urological health issues that are unique to their anatomy. While numerous urological conditions can affect women of all ages for a variety of reasons, childbirth, menopause or a hysterectomy can alter the body in ways that could lead to conditions including pelvic floor weakness, overactive bladder or inflammation of the bladder wall (interstitial cystitis). Fortunately, most conditions are highly treatable, especially when caught early.<br />
	<br />
	I am one of three physicians at The Urology Group to be certified in Female Pelvic Medicine &amp; Reconstructive Surgery. This specialization gives my colleagues, Dr. Rebecca Roedersheimer and Dr. Phil Buffington, better insight, leading to better patient care. We treat the following conditions:<br />
	<br />
	&bull; Urinary Tract Infections/Bladder Infections - Most women will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) at some point in their lives. The infection develops when bacteria enter the urinary tract. Women with a UTI may have pain or burning when they urinate. They may also feel a sudden urge to go to the bathroom, but then have trouble urinating. UTIs can be serious, but they also can be treated with antibiotics.<br />
	<br />
	&bull;&nbsp; Overactive Bladder (OAB) - OAB is a condition recognized by symptoms including urinary urgency, frequent urination, waking up at least twice a night to urinate or urge incontinence (leakage of urine). Treatments range from medication or nerve stimulation to Botox injections or surgery. At least 30 million Americans suffer from overactive bladder.<br />
	<br />
	&bull; Urinary Leakage/Incontinence - Millions of women experience involuntary loss of urine, called urinary incontinence. The condition affects all ages and women of every social and economic level, though urinary incontinence occurs more often in older women than in young women. The condition can be driven by stress or by a weakness in bladder or pelvic floor muscles and can be treated with a variety of approaches, depending on severity.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	&middot; Pelvic Floor Weakness/Vaginal Prolapse/&quot;Dropped Bladder&quot; - Pelvic floor prolapse occurs when the upper portion of the vagina loses its normal shape and sags or drops down into the vaginal canal or even outside of the vaginal opening. There are several types of pelvic floor prolapse including bladder, rectum, small bowel and uterus. It&rsquo;s wise not to let the condition go on too long, as most worsening pelvic floor prolapses can only be fully corrected with surgery.<br />
	<br />
	&middot; Pelvic Pain/Interstitial Cystitis - Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a long-term inflammation of the bladder wall, also called painful bladder syndrome. Its symptoms are very similar to a urinary tract infection, such as urinary urgency and/or pelvic pain, but lack an identifiable cause such as bacterial infection. In the past, IC was believed to be a relatively uncommon problem, but now it is thought to affect up to 12 percent of women.<br />
	<br />
	Though women can be reluctant to talk about these sensitive issues, it is important to share details with and seek treatment from a certified urologist. Not doing so not only diminishes your quality of life, but can put you at serious risk.<br />

115,2018: The Year in Review,"Looking back on our patients, our physicians and our community. ","<p>
	As one year comes to a close and another one begins, I am amazed when looking back all that we accomplished in 2018. Perhaps you find yourself doing the same thing. Where did you excel and where did you find challenges in your personal life, business life, with family and friends, and even with your health?</p>
<p>
	At The Urology Group, we spent 2018 seeing patients not only in our offices, but also in the community. Interacting with our patients in the community is one of our greatest joys throughout the year. Here are two examples:&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/1064/_TRA8005.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; float: right;"" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		On July 27 we honored many of our patients who are Korean War veterans by hosting a luncheon at GE Aviation Centre, to mark the 65th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War. More than 70 Korean War Veterans and their guests joined us for a patriotic program on this momentous occasion. It was truly a moving experience to be able to thank these men and women for their service.</li>
	<li>
		On September 22 our community raised over $115,000 to end prostate cancer at The Gentlemen Stakes 5K for Prostate Cancer at Belterra Park. This was our first time taking the event off of our campus, and Belterra Park proved to be a perfect location. We couldn&rsquo;t have hit this goal without your help. Our friends at ZERO &ndash; The End of Prostate Cancer are extremely grateful for your contributions. The money raised will help ZERO increase awareness and education in order to create Generation ZERO &ndash; the first generation of men free from prostate cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Speaking of prostate cancer, 2018 marked the fifth year that The Urology Group has been treating prostate cancer with the highly precise CyberKnife&reg; stereotactic body radiation therapy. To date we have treated nearly 1,600 men with this innovative technology.</p>
<p>
	One of my favorite parts of my job is working with our employees. In 2018 we hired additional staff members, including two new physicians &ndash; <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/meet-the-urology-group/matthew-love/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Matthew A. Love</a>&nbsp; in our Hamilton office and <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/meet-the-urology-group/brian-minnillo/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Brian J. Minnillo</a>&nbsp; in our Anderson and Eastgate offices. We&rsquo;re excited to welcome both physicians to our ever-growing team at The Urology Group.</p>
<p>
	With you in mind, this year we added an <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/services-we-offer/pharmacy/"" target=""_blank"">in-house pharmacy</a>&nbsp; and upgraded our <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/portal/"" target=""_blank"">patient portal</a> to serve you better. In the new year, we will continue to pursue the latest technologies and least invasive treatment options in order to offer the best urologic care in the tri-state area</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re planning for an even better 2019 and look forward to sharing it with you. As you reflect on your year, we wish you a joyful holiday season and a healthy 2019.</p>

<p>
	This year marks a special anniversary for The Urology Group. In 2016, we celebrate 20 years of providing the most advanced urologic care in the region and we want to thank each of you for the important role you&rsquo;ve played in our history.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I am grateful to all of you for putting your care and trust in us. While our staff has made us strong, it is because of all of our patients that we have grown and thrived.<br />
	<br />
	In 1996, I was proud to work with the founding physicians of The Urology Group to establish this organization. We set out to build a practice that would allow us to remain independent while providing the needed care to improve patients&rsquo; lives. Today, I&rsquo;m even more proud to see how far we&rsquo;ve come.<br />
	<br />
	We&rsquo;ve grown from 23 to more than 40 physicians in 12 locations and a staff of more than 300. Today we are one of the largest specialty groups of urologists in the United States and we remain dedicated to the same mission that drove us to start this practice.<br />
	<br />
	Our success has resulted from many factors, most importantly the people.<br />
	<br />
	We have a depth of talent unmatched in the region with the most knowledgeable and experienced physicians, nurses, technicians and staff. Through them, The Urology Group has become a true asset to the community. We have established a national reputation as urology experts and are regarded as a center of expertise.<br />
	<br />
	To celebrate this milestone, we commissioned an art piece that will serve as a permanent visual representation of our teamwork. The brass tree entitled &ldquo;Working and Growing Together&rdquo; includes leaves decorated by our staff members. Each leaf symbolizes the employee&rsquo;s unique contribution while collectively creating a beautiful work of art. The tree represents our commitment to quality care, rooted in tradition while branching out to keep pace with changing times.<br />
	<br />
	We invite you to see it the next time you are in our Norwood location.<br />
	<br />
	In the years ahead, our organizational journey will continue taking us in new directions and exploring new opportunities. Our 20th anniversary is a significant milestone on that journey, and we are looking forward to what&rsquo;s ahead.</p>

78,Urolift: New Treatment Option for Enlarged Prostate,Urolift offers permanent help for common problem,"<p>
	When men reach a certain age, problems with the prostate become fairly common. More than 70% of men in their 60s have symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) &ndash; a total of more than 500 million men worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px; line-height: 1.6em;"">Most symptoms of BPH stem from obstruction of the urethra and a gradual loss of bladder function. The most common symptoms involve changes or problems with urination, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Difficulty starting to urinate</li>
	<li>
		Interrupted or weak urine stream</li>
	<li>
		Urine dribbling or leakage</li>
	<li>
		More frequent urination, or feeling the need to urinate, especially at night.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px; line-height: 1.6em;"">While BPH is a non-cancerous condition, it can cause a loss of productivity and sleep, depression and decreased quality of life.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px; line-height: 1.6em;"">A new treatment provides an option for local patients: UroLift, the first permanent implant for the symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px; line-height: 1.6em;"">The UroLift System permanent implants, delivered during a minimally invasive procedure, act like window curtain tie-backs to hold the lobes of an enlarged prostate open. This simple process does not require any cutting, heating or removal of prostate tissue. Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with little downtime.</span></p>
<p>
	Results from clinical trials showed that patients receiving UroLift implants reported rapid improvement of their symptoms, including improved urinary flow rates, and sustained sexual function. Patients also experienced a significant improvement in quality of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If you notice symptoms of BPH, notify your physician to ensure you receive a prostate exam as part of your next routine checkup. Though the need for treatment is not usually urgent, the issue should be raised before it becomes bothersome or presents a health risk.&nbsp;</p>

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Place your hands at the back of your rib cage, above your waist. This is where your kidneys live. Get to know this place. If you experience pain in the lower side of the back, blood in your urine, unexplained weight loss or a lump in your abdomen, call your physician. High risk factors for kidney cancer include tobacco smoke, obesity and certain chemicals. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Lastly, just to be sure you understand how important kidneys are for purifying your blood: Every day, they filter enough fluids to equal about 400 blood donations. So, during Kidney Cancer Awareness Month, pat your rib cage knowingly next time you get near chemicals, smoke or unhealthy foods. Your kidneys will take care of you, especially if you take care of them. </font></p>

116,February is Cancer Prevention Month: Join the Fortunate 40,Did you know that more than 40% of all cancers stem from preventable causes? ,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Here&rsquo;s one way to size up the potential of cancer prevention: Of the estimated 1.7 million new cancer cases expected to be diagnosed in 2019, the number of people who could fend it off can fill nearly nine Super Bowl stadiums. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">That&rsquo;s 680,000 cases, which represents the more than 40% of all cancers that stem from preventable causes such as smoking and physical inactivity. As we enter February, which is National Cancer Prevention Month, we should let this fact guide us and our loved ones.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">We&rsquo;re making progress toward that fortunate 40%. In 2019, an estimated 1,660 Americans are expected to die from cancer every day, but for those diagnosed today, the five-year survival rate is 40% higher than it was 40 years ago &ndash; 69% compared with 49%, according to a <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2019/cancer-facts-and-figures-2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">2019 report by the American Cancer Society</a>. This translated to more than 2.6 million fewer cancer deaths from 1991 to 2016 (nearly the population of Chicago).</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If more than 40% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. can be sidelined, the prognosis is especially encouraging for the four cancers we specialize in detecting and treating at The Urology Group. Here&rsquo;s the best defense for each: </font></p>
<ul>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Prostate:</strong> Though among the most common cancers &ndash; an estimated 174,650 new cases are projected to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2019 &ndash; prostate malignancies are also among the most treatable. The five-year survival rate is 99%. Thirty years ago, 83% of patients survived five years. Early detection, which can be achieved through a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, is key. <a href=""https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/news-calendar/News_detail/thirty-percent-fewer-prostate-cancer-deaths-with-psa-screening.cid1605960"" target=""_blank"">A recent study from the University of Gothenburg</a> concludes that PSAs reduce prostate cancer deaths by about 30%. If you are 50 and older or at high risk, ask your doctor about a screening. </font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Kidney:</strong> Of the&nbsp;73,820 people expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2019, nearly 60% will be men, many older &ndash; the average age of diagnosis is 64. Kidney cancer is highly curable: If it&rsquo;s detected early and confined to the organ, the five-year survival rate can be as high as 97%. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, lower back pain and a lump on the side or lower back. Smoking and obesity are high risk factors; a diet of nutrient-rich fresh foods and regular exercise enhance prevention.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Bladder:</strong> Our bladders store and therefore are exposed to everything our urine contains, including the toxins in tobacco smoke. In fact, cigarette smoke causes more than half of the bladder cancers in the U.S., <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bladder-cancer-smokers/most-smokers-with-bladder-cancer-know-tobacco-was-the-cause-idUSKCN0IV1S920141111"" target=""_blank"">a study by Kaiser Permanente reports</a>. In 2019, nearly 80,470 new cases are expected to be diagnosed; 61,700 in men. The best prevention includes avoiding cigarette smoke and staying well hydrated with caffeine- and alcohol-free fluids. Those who see blood in their urine, pee more frequently and experience pain while doing so should get tested. The five-year survival rate is 77%.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Testicular:</strong> Unlike most cancers, testicular cancer tends to occur at a younger age &ndash; the average patient is 33. It is rare, developing in just one of every 250 men in their lifetimes, according to the <a href=""https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html"" target=""_blank"">American Cancer Society</a>. And in most cases, the five-year survival rate is better than 95%. Still, monthly self-exams are recommended. Symptom include pain in one or both testicles, changes in their shape or size and pressure in the lower back, abdomen or groin. If you&rsquo;re unsure, ask your doctor to perform a screening. </font></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">This month, let&rsquo;s do our best to reduce the number of people populating the cancer statistics. Prevention is within your reach.

111,What to Know about a Dropped Bladder,"When something just doesn't feel right or feels out of place, pelvic floor prolapse could be the issue.","<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/18/Buffington_web.png"" style=""float: right;"" /></font><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Many medical conditions are straightforward and easy to explain. However, some occur and cause a person to just not feel right &ndash; like something is out of place. For women, this could be a sign of pelvic floor prolapse.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Many women (about 30-40%) experience pelvic floor prolapse or &ldquo;dropped bladder&rdquo; during their lifetime. Pelvic floor prolapse can cause a sensation that tissues or structures in the vagina are out of place. The condition occurs when the weight-bearing or stabilizing structures that keep the vagina in place weaken or deteriorate. In turn, the upper portion of the vagina loses its normal shape and sags or drops down into the vaginal canal or even outside of the vaginal opening.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A pelvic floor prolapse can be caused by childbirth, menopause, a hysterectomy, obesity and advanced age. When pelvic floor prolapse occurs, a variety of symptoms can appear depending on the type of prolapse. <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/conditions-we-treat/pelvic-floor-weakness/"" target=""_blank"">Click here to learn about the four types</a>.</font></p>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Symptoms may include:</font></strong><br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Pressure or fullness in the vagina or pelvis </font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Painful intercourse (dyspareunia)</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Difficulty emptying the bowel and/or bladder</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Constipation</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Urinary stress incontinence</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Pain that increases during long periods of standing</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A lump or protrusion of tissue at the opening of the vagina&nbsp;</font></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Symptoms don&rsquo;t always appear, so some women may have pelvic floor prolapse and not know it. However, if symptoms do surface, solutions are available. Treatment options depend on the severity of the prolapse, whether the woman is sexually active, and her personal preferences. In some cases, lifestyle changes or exercise may suffice.</font></p>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Nonsurgical treatments include:</font></strong><br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Activity modification, such as avoiding heavy lifting or straining</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Kegel exercises, which are simple strengthening exercises that can tighten the muscles of the pelvic floor</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A pessary (a small plastic or silicone medical device) can be inserted into the vagina for support</font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Estrogen replacement therapy can help strengthen and maintain muscles in the vagina</font></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">In some situations, surgery may be required as most worsening pelvic floor prolapses can only be corrected with surgery. A variety of surgical treatment options are available, depending on the woman&rsquo;s situation and preferences.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If you are experiencing symptoms of a pelvic floor prolapse, don&rsquo;t ignore discomfort or the feeling that something is out of place. A urologist can provide the diagnosis and recommendations for proper treatment.</font></p>

81,An Historic Tribute: The 75th Anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor,The Urology Group Hosts Pearl Harbor Recognition Event for Patients,"<div>
	On Dec. 7, the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the date President Franklin Roosevelt said &ldquo;would live in infamy,&rdquo; The Urology Group paid tribute to many of our patients who served their country during World War II.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We were fortunate to have had nearly 75 WWII veterans and their guests attend the luncheon and patriotic program. The luncheon was coordinated as a small gesture to salute local men and women for their WWII service and sacrifice, and to let them know they are appreciated all these years later. The truth is, we were the real beneficiaries of the event. It allowed us to meet and hear the stories of the many real-life heroes who were in attendance.</div>
<p>
	<img alt="""" src=""/Media/873/Pearl_Harbor_Veterans_Group.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 305px;"" /></p>
<div>
	Many of the veterans also agreed to share their stories with invited students from Princeton High School, who will create a living-history project and video. The project will be shared with the veterans in attendance as well as local veterans&rsquo; organizations. The preservation of their personal accounts of war&mdash;whether from a foxhole or behind a desk&mdash;is essential to capturing the full historical perspective, but the project will, hopefully, also create context and appreciation for the students involved.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, led directly to our country&rsquo;s entry into WWII, forever changing our lives and triggering our country&rsquo;s commitment to the defense of freedom. We are proud to honor those who played a role in that history and continue to instill their values and leadership among our youth. It is our hope that by bringing together the men and women who answered the call of duty more than seven decades ago with the youth of our community, we can both honor the past and inspire the future.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The Urology Group chose to honor WWII veterans on this special occasion because they are our patients, but more importantly, because they represent the courage and sacrifice of an entire generation &ndash; the Greatest Generation. We are proud to repay, in a small way, the men and women whose contributions helped preserve and protect our nation through World War II.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Of the 16 million U.S. service members from WWII, only about 620,000 remain. This was believed to be the largest gathering of WWII veterans on this anniversary outside of Hawaii where the national commemoration took place. &nbsp;</div>

	<span style=""font-size:12px;"">Staying healthy is at the top of most people&rsquo;s minds, especially in the new year. But saying and doing are two very different things. Being committed to a healthy lifestyle is about making good daily choices about what you eat, exercising, destressing and managing other risk factors. </span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:12px;"">I</span><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">&nbsp;always encourage patients who want to begin a new workout regimen in the new year. However, big and sudden changes can often be difficult to sustain. So, alongside your New Year&rsquo;s resolution, I recommend also including some simpler changes that can lead to improved health.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Eat healthy foods. </strong>Eating healthy foods is key to keeping your body in good shape. We all know it, but sometimes our schedules prevent us from making good choices. A quick trip to the drive-thru or a vending machine is convenient but not healthy. Plan meals ahead of time. Pack appropriate portion-sized healthy snacks and have them handy at work, in the car or wherever you frequent. At restaurants, eliminating extras like sour cream, butter, heavy dressings and fries makes eating out just a bit healthier.&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Stay active. </strong>Exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to be at the gym or involve an hour-long commitment to a treadmill. Talk a short walk at lunch or in the evening. Park a little farther from the door of the mall, grocery store or your office to get in a few extra steps. Take the stairs instead of an elevator or escalator. Get up from your desk or couch every 30 minutes just to make sure you&rsquo;re moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Relax.</strong> Stress is a large contributor to health problems. When we get caught up with worries, our bodies react in negative ways. Blood pressure rises. Muscles tense. The digestive system is compromised. Fatigue sets in. All of these symptoms can then affect our ability and desire to eat right and stay active, creating an unhealthy cycle. Incorporate opportunities in your day for relaxation, whether it&rsquo;s through a yoga class or simply doing something you enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Manage risk factors.</strong> No matter how healthy your lifestyle, you may still be at risk for certain diseases. Be proactive about your health. Learn your family medical history and get screened for conditions for which you have a higher risk. There are other conditions, especially certain cancers, that everyone should be screened for once they hit a certain age. Talk to your doctor at your annual checkup about how to manage your risk factors.&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
</ol>
<div>
	<span style=""font-size:12px;"">We at The Urology Group wish you and yours good health in the new year!&nbsp;</span></div>

121,It’s Testicular Cancer Awareness Month: 6 Facts You Should Know,The American Cancer Society reports that about one of every 250 males develops testicular cancer during his lifetime.,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Call it one of life&rsquo;s ironies: The average age when men reach their physical peaks (33) is the same year they are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s an irony we are increasingly able to deal with.<img alt="""" src=""/Media/15/Bey.png"" style=""width: 233px; height: 214px; float: right;"" /></font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The American Cancer Society reports that about one of every 250 males develops testicular cancer during his lifetime, which makes it somewhat uncommon. Since it occurs among men at a young age, and is not highly prevalent, it is of greater risk of being overlooked.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">April is Testicular Cancer Awareness Month, so let&rsquo;s give it a look. Following are six testicular cancer facts that will help you to better understand the disease and the male body.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 1:</strong> It can strike at an older age. While testicular cancer is most likely to develop in young and middle-aged men, nearly 8% are among men older than 55.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 2:</strong> It is among the most common &ldquo;uncommon&rdquo; cancers. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in males aged 15 to 34. Education, including how to perform a self-examination (see below), should start early.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 3:</strong> It frequently comes from germs (but not the kind you think). Most testicular cancers develop in the germ cells, or reproductive cells, which produce sperm. There are two types of germ cell cancers: seminomas, which typically are slower growing; and non-seminomas, which grow more quickly. Tumors may include both cells.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 4:</strong> Other things grow in there. The testicles can host a lot of other growths that are not cancerous. Among them are hydroceles (fluid-filled sacs), varicoceles (enlarged veins in the scrotum) and spermatoceles (painless cysts in the epididymis).</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 5:</strong> Men can still use the &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; sign. Testicular cancer tends to occur in just one testicle, which may be removed as part of treatment. However, the other testicle will often still be able to produce enough hormones to support a healthy sex drive. The removal of a testicle will not affect the ability to have an erection, though it can diminish fertility.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Fact 6</strong>: We can outlive it! If detected early, the prognosis for testicular cancer recovery is excellent. The lifetime risk of dying from this cancer is only about 1 in 5,000, because treatment is so effective. </font></p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Test Time: How to Perform a Self-Exam</font></strong></h3>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Staying ahead of testicular cancer means detecting it and understanding the factors that put men at higher risk. These factors include a family history of the disease, one or two undescended testicles, and Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic disorder that causes low testosterone levels).</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Self-exams should be performed monthly even if these risks are not present. All a man needs is a shower and two hands. Here&rsquo;s how:</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">1. Using both hands, cup one testicle at a time.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">2. With a slight bit of pressure, roll the testicle between the thumb and fingers. One should familiarize himself with the cords and tubes at the back of the testicles to know the landscape.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">3. Feel for lumps, irregularities or a change in size. &nbsp;Note that it&rsquo;s normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">In all, it should take just a few minutes. The key is to perform self-exams on a regular basis, like the first of every month, so any changes are easy to recognize. If inconsistencies are detected, contact a urologist right away.</font></p>

118,March and Vasectomies: Betting on a Guiltfree Way to Watch the Games,Have you decided on your MVP? (March Vasectomy Procedure),"<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Here&rsquo;s an idea for those thinking about their NCAA Tournament brackets: Before even considering your Final Four, how about deciding your MVP? That would be your March Vasectomy Procedure. <img alt="""" src=""/Media/1070/basketball.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; float: right;"" /></font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">For several years now, men (and women) have recognized the opportunity in scheduling non-emergency medical procedures before long-running sports events. The Final Four is no exception&mdash;by scheduling a vasectomy in advance of the first games in mid-March, a man can relax on the couch and watch college ball for days, guilt-free, while getting something very important done (for the whole family).</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Nearly 100 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch the entire NCAA tournament in 2018. Of the 500,000 men who got vasectomies last year, we can say confidently the ones who timed their procedures with the games were smart.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If you are thinking about a vasectomy, you can be among the cheering MVP patients in 2019. But, because the procedure requires a consultation with your urologist in advance, get on the schedule now. <span style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</span>Schedule a consultation with your urologist now&mdash;before Selection Sunday&mdash;and you can plan your vasectomy recovery to coincide with the First Four tip-off on March 19 or the Final Four Championship on April 6.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">But first: Be sure you&rsquo;re ready. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Be a Bracket Buster</font></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Many important factors should be considered before deciding to get a vasectomy, but performance should not be one of them. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">So let&rsquo;s eliminate all misconceptions at the start: A vasectomy will not change your testosterone levels because the procedure does not stop your body&rsquo;s ability to produce sperm. It simply severs the tubes sperm need to travel through on their passage from the testes, where they are produced, to the penis. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Sexual functions and sensations do not change. There is still even an ejaculate that looks and feels the same, because the prostate and seminal vesicle glands (which produce many of the components of semen) will continue to make fluids. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The only difference is there are no sperm in the fluid; the sperm is withheld and eventually absorbed into the body.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">3-Point Recovery</font></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Changing a bodily function requires preparation, however. In the case of a vasectomy, much of that preparation involves planning ahead.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A vasectomy is an outpatient procedure and only takes about 30 minutes. However, you will still need to take it easy in the five to seven days after surgery. These are prime circumstances to watch others play the courts in Hartford, Salt Lake City or De Moines. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Here&rsquo;s what you should know: </font></p>
<ol>
	<li style=""margin: 0px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><em>Jock it up. </em>Bring a pair of tight-fitting underwear or an athletic supporter to cradle your scrotum after the procedure. You&rsquo;ll be sore, and ice packs or a bag of frozen peas on the incision will help. Your doctor will likely advise that you lie down and rest for six to eight hours directly after the operation. A small, bloody discharge may emerge from the incision site; this is normal.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><em>Ice it up. </em>You might continue to experience achy, swollen and/or bruised testicles and scrotum for up to a week after the vasectomy, so keep the frozen peas coming. Be patient. Your favorite teams may be headed to Louisville, Anaheim and Kansas City, but remaining couch-bound alleviates being ouch-bound. Continue to avoid strenuous activity, including heavy lifting and sexual intercourse. </font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><em>Play it safe.</em> Residual sperm will remain in the patient&rsquo;s system for as long as a few months after the vasectomy, so you likely won&rsquo;t be fully sterile until after the bracket wins are announced in Minneapolis. In fact, it will take 15 to 20 ejaculations to clear out the residual reproducing sperm. We recommend using birth control until your physician gives you the green light. </font></li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">One and Done </font></strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Though technically reversible, a vasectomy should be considered a permanent procedure. So be sure. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Have frank conversations with your loved ones and physician. Once you decide the procedure will result in a richer, more satisfying lifestyle based on your planned goals&mdash;beyond the Final Four&mdash;then you&rsquo;re ready. </font></p>

83,Help for ED is Just a Doctor's Visit Away,Solutions for Erectile Dysfunction (ED) start with a consultation with a physician. ,"<p>
	An estimated 30 million American men suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED), making it difficult or impossible for them to have intercourse.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">It is a condition that impacts the patient&rsquo;s mental well-being as well as his physical health. Many feel helpless and embarrassed. And while it can be devastating to those directly affected, it can be similarly so for their partners who may feel isolated, undesirable or even to blame.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">But help can be just a doctor visit away.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">A physical examination, including sexual history and a psychosocial evaluation to determine stress levels, is the first step to diagnosing not just what is happening, or not happening, but why.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">Despite the seemingly simple process, much goes into the action of achieving an erection &mdash; nerves in the brain send chemical messages to the blood vessels causing blood to flow to the penis. If everything goes as planned, the penis will rise to the occasion.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">But occasionally, things do not go as planned. Physical causes stem from a breakdown in the sequence of events that leads to an erection, usually from low blood flow in the erectile tissue, but also from impaired nerve impulses sent from the brain. Some diseases that can also cause ED include diabetes, kidney disease, vascular disease, neurological diseases and prostate cancer.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">Additionally, about 25 percent of ED cases can be attributed to medications for other conditions.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">While it is true that ED is&nbsp;most typically associated with older men, the disease is affecting an increasing number of younger men, many in their 20s and 30s.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">The good news is that a variety of treatments &mdash; from medication to surgery &mdash; are available and the physicians at The Urology Group can help determine which one is most appropriate for each patient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size: 13.024px;"">Many couples are dealing with erectile dysfunction. If you are one of them, talk to your doctor, find the plan that is right for you and get your love life back on track.&nbsp;</span></p>

84,Kidney Cancer Rarely Shows Symptoms,Kidney cancer typically shows no symptoms.,"<p>
	Kidney cancer is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women. This video provides an overview: <a href=""https://youtu.be/O8562bOSSZM"" target=""_blank"">click to view</a>.</p>
<p>
	According to The American Cancer Society, more than 50,000 new cases of kidney cancer will occur in 2017 and about 14,400 people will die from the disease.<br />
	<br />
	Unlike many cancers, such as prostate or breast, there is no recommended screening test for kidney cancer. And because early kidney cancers do not usually produce any signs or symptoms, it is easy to go unnoticed until the disease has progressed.<br />
	<br />
	This makes it especially important for those at a higher risk of developing the disease to know to the symptoms that can occur and alert their urologists with any concerns.<br />
	<br />
	Symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A lump in the abdomen</li>
	<li>
		Pain in the flank or side</li>
	<li>
		Decreased appetite</li>
	<li>
		Low blood count (anemia)</li>
	<li>
		Weight loss</li>
	<li>
		Blood in the urine (hematuria)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	A variety of genetic and lifestyle choices can increase one&rsquo;s risk of developing kidney cancer, including family history, obesity, smoking and some inherited conditions. You can find a full list here from the American Cancer Society. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Testing usually includes blood work, urinalysis, a CT scan, an MRI and in rare cases a biopsy. A CT scan can identify a growth in the kidney and usually determine if it is malignant.<br />
	<br />
	The treatment approach depends on the patient&rsquo;s condition as well as the stage and size of the tumor. If treatment is recommended, tumor removal with minimally invasive techniques using laparoscopy or robotics can often replace larger-incision approaches, which reduces pain, hospitalization and recovery time.<br />
	<br />
	Treatment for a patient whose cancer has metastasized typically involves removal of the affected kidney followed by chemotherapy. Many new and promising chemotherapies are available for the treatment of kidney cancer.<br />
	<br />
	Research and recent advances in technology help us understand more about kidney cancer and how to treat it. If you have concerns or questions about kidney cancer, talk with your urologist.<br />

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The free screening was in response to a series of studies conducted over the last several years showing evidence of higher cancer rate&ndash;including prostate and testicular cancers&ndash;among firefighters.

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/215/WomanTennis.jpg"" style=""width: 243px; height: 356px; float: right;"" />Life brings continual changes, and while many are worth celebrating, some can be difficult to deal with. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">For post-menopausal women, vaginal dryness due to hormonal change (called vaginal atrophy) is quite common. Studies indicate that it affects between 50 and 60 percent of women within this group.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Yet many women don&rsquo;t feel comfortable talking about their condition, typically because of embarrassment, the fear of the unknown or the belief that nothing can be done. As a result, they continue suffering in silence. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">However, vaginal changes are a normal part of aging.&nbsp;Vaginal atrophy is generally caused by&nbsp;lowered estrogen levels&nbsp;from changes in the ovarian function. This results in vaginal dryness, irritation and often painful sexual intercourse. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The condition can also lead t</font><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">o urogenital changes that include frequent urinary tract infections, increased urinary frequency and incontinence and burning with urination. Clearly, it can impact a woman&rsquo;s overall quality of life. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">But, normal doesn&rsquo;t mean untreatable. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A solution for many women is MonaLisa Touch. During this procedure, a urologist uses a laser to deliver controlled energy that stimulates the production of collagen. This leads to enhanced moisture levels in the vaginal canal, which can ease the painful symptoms. No anesthesia is necessary, and treatments consist of three in-office sessions lasting approximately five minutes each. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">May is National Women&rsquo;s Health Month, an effort to raise awareness about manageable steps women can take to improve their health and the importance of incorporating simple preventive and positive health behaviors into everyday life. That includes having open, honest discussions with health care professionals about symptoms &ndash; including vaginal atrophy &ndash; so women can experience relief and regain their quality of life. </font></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">During the heat of summer, it is important to stay hydrated. But for those with an overactive bladder (OAB), it may be tempting to skip the eight glasses of water in hopes of keeping trips to the bathroom to a minimum. </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The symptoms of an overactive bladder (OAB) &ndash; feeling an urgency to urinate frequently &mdash; are quite common. Studies show that about 33 million Americans suffer from the disorder.<span style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp; </span>Symptoms include:</font></p>

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">But you don&rsquo;t have to suffer in silence. A visit to a urologist can provide a variety of possible treatments.

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Father&rsquo;s Day is a great time to say thanks to Dad and recognize him for the steps he takes to make your family better. For many, a father signifies strength, cohesion and support. But often, fathers fail to pay as much attention to themselves and their own well-being as they give to other members of the family. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Here are four easy gifts you can give Dad that are more meaningful than any tie, tool or cologne you could buy. These gifts can keep him strong and healthy and improve his quality of life. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Get an annual physical. </strong>For whatever reason, many men avoid seeing a doctor until something major goes wrong. Whether it&rsquo;s fear of getting bad news, a feeling of weakness or simply because they have no time, going to the doctor is often the last thing on a man&rsquo;s to-do list. But routine checkups and health screenings are increasingly important as a man ages. They can prevent some situations from getting more serious or provide more options for treatment if conditions are caught early. <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/annual-physical-examinations#1-2"" target=""_blank"">WebMD</a> offers a great overview of what to expect at an annual checkup.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Stay active.</strong> It sounds obvious, but physical activity is a key to good health. Unfortunately, our culture breeds a sedentary lifestyle, from desk jobs and long commutes to too much screen time. This inactivity leads to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. A <a href=""http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/07/lack-of-exercise--not-diet--linked-to-rise-in-obesity--stanford-.html"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Medicine health survey</a> suggests that inactivity, rather than higher calorie intake, could be driving the surge in obesity.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Watch what you eat.</strong> The adage &ldquo;You are what you eat&rdquo; is so true. Processed, high-calorie foods have not done our society any favors. With Americans eating and drinking about one-third of their calories away from home, staying on top of which restaurants offer healthy options isn&rsquo;t always easy. Fortunately, the FDA has recently passed a requirement for more nutrition labeling in chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments to provide consumers with clear and consistent nutrition information.</font></p>
<h4 style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><em><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Gift idea #3: </strong>Make reservations for Father&rsquo;s Day brunch or dinner at a restaurant that already includes nutritional information on its menu. Make sure you both choose healthy options!</font></em></font></h4>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Mental health matters.</strong> In fact, many physicians agree it&rsquo;s as important as physical health when it comes to fighting off illness or disease. Allowing feelings of stress, fear or sadness to go unaddressed can lead to depression. As adults age, it&rsquo;s important to maintain a sense of purpose by staying connected to people and things that matter to them. Transportation, financial limitations or other health issues may make this difficult. </font></p>

91,ASC Week: Recognizing the Value Outpatient Surgery Centers Offer Patients,"National ASC Week, Aug. 7- 11, recognizes the value surgical centers and their staffs bring toward delivering cost-effective outpatient care.","<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Technological and medical breakthroughs are transforming what it means to have surgery in America. Procedures that were once lengthy and complex, requiring long hospital stays are now routinely performed as safe, outpatient procedures.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">In 1998, the physicians of The Urology Group sought out a way to harness new technology and put our patients more solidly at the center of their care. The result was the founding of The Urology Center, the outpatient surgery center located at our Norwood campus. Today, our surgery center is the highest-volume urology-only surgery center in the country, treating more than 15,500 outpatient cases each year. More than 240,000 cases have been handled by our physicians in this surgery center since its opening.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Typical procedures performed in the surgery center include:</span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>

		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Bladder control, specifically urodynamics, biofeedback, PTNS, Botox injections, InterStim therapy, incontinence slings</span></span></p>

			<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Penile prosthesis</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Prostate treatment, including brachytherapy and transurethral resection of the prostate</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">And while I am incredibly proud of the forethought that we displayed nearly 20 years ago in developing it, we are now in good company. Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs), modern healthcare facilities focused on providing same-day surgical care, have transformed the outpatient experience by providing patients with a more convenient alternative to hospital-based stays. During National ASC Week, Aug. 7- 11, we recognize all of those surgical centers and the staffs who put patients ahead of profits and deliver extraordinary, cost-effective outpatient care.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">By operating in ACSs instead of hospitals, physicians gain increased control over their surgical practices. In a surgical center setting, physicians and other medical staff can tailor the surgery experience more specifically to the needs of the patients and the staff. ASCs can provide physicians with more professional freedom over their work environment and the quality of care provided. The result is high patient satisfaction levels at a time when patients are at odds with most of America&rsquo;s healthcare system.</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">In addition to a more patient-centric approach to care, ASCs deliver more cost-effective care. Less expensive treatment saves billions of dollars for those involved in the payment process &mdash; patients, private insurance and Medicaid. And it is certain that ASCs will continue to play an essential role in healthcare, especially as the American population ages.</span></span></p>

93,Life-extending Treatment Particularly Effective for African-American Men,Life-extending prostate cancer treatment particularly effective for African-American men ,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Before the clock officially runs out on Prostate Cancer Awareness Month in September, it&rsquo;s important to raise awareness of a&nbsp;life-extending treatment for advanced prostate cancer that is particularly beneficial for African-American men.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in African- American men, representing 31 percent of all cancers in these men, according to the American Cancer Society. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">It&rsquo;s vital to get&nbsp;the word out that an FDA-approved immunotherapy has been shown to provide an additional overall survival benefit of 9.3 months for African-American men compared to&nbsp;Caucasian men for those suffering from advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to first-line therapy.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Prostate cancer is considered advanced if it has spread outside the prostate to other parts of the body. First-line therapy consists of medication that blocks the man&rsquo;s production of testosterone (hormone therapy), since testosterone feeds the growth of prostate cancer. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The numbers tell the story about men who received immunotherapy in a real-world treatment setting. They show how men with advanced prostate cancer benefitted. Life was extended by 37.3 months for African American men and for 28 months for Caucasian men.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">When African-American men with advanced prostate cancer are identified at the earliest possible stage that they begin to fail hormone therapy, the benefits of immunotherapy are significantly greater: 54.3 months for&nbsp;African-American patients versus 33.4 months for Caucasian patients. These compelling immunotherapy results were delivered at&nbsp;this year&rsquo;s annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA).</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">

92,Path of Totality for Kidney Stone Relief,"Kidney stone pain is real and intense, but our physicians offer relief through lithotripsy. ","<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Monday&#39;s solar eclipse was quite a natural phenomenon. Millions watched as the moon blocked the sun and for just a few minutes, the world was in awe.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">However, sometimes when one thing blocks another, it isn&rsquo;t an awe-inspiring event. That&rsquo;s the case with kidney stones, which can be very painful. Kidney stones develop when minerals and salts form crystals in the urine, causing pain when they pass down and block the ureter. This results in urine backing up into the kidney.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Occurring much more frequently than a solar eclipse, kidney stones develop in one in 10 people at some point in their lives, according to the National Kidney Foundation.</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Sometimes the stones pass on their own within a few days or weeks with a simple regimen of drinking plenty of water (at least three quarts a day) and possibly adding alpha-blocker medication. But when stubborn or large stones won&rsquo;t move on their own, a number of other treatments can offer relief. </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; line-height: normal;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">One common procedure, called lithotripsy, uses high-energy shock waves to break up stones into tiny pieces, allowing them to pass through the urine.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s somewhat like creating a meteor shower in your urinary tract. The Urology Group&rsquo;s lithotripsy procedure is one of the few in the nation to offer a built-in ultrasound. This allows our physicians to more easily pinpoint the type and location of the stones. </font></p>

94,Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer,Getting tested for prostate cancer doesn't always mean seeking immediate treatment.,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Did you know that getting tested for prostate cancer doesn&#39;t always mean seeking immediate treatment? Each patient is different and what is &ldquo;best&rdquo; for one may not be &ldquo;best&rdquo; for another. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Active surveillance is a decision not to treat prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis. Active surveillance may be used in a couple of very different clinical settings.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<iframe align=""right"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/T0Gx563xmgA?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Some men diagnosed with prostate cancer may be quite elderly, or in frail overall health. A basic tenet of prostate cancer treatment is that men who do not have a ten-year life expectancy, either due to age or poor overall health, may not need treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy at all. These patients may simply be observed. In this setting, the urologist will follow the patient&rsquo;s PSA level and overall health periodically. If the patient has been deemed a poor candidate for potentially curative treatment based on age or health, and the cancer progresses, it is common to employ hormone therapy, which is almost always effective at slowing the growth of prostate cancer. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Recent research also indicates that immediate prostate cancer treatment may be deferred for a subgroup of healthy men with very low-risk prostate cancer. While experts differ as to who exactly may qualify for this form of active surveillance, most authorities suggest that it is appropriate for men with no more than one or two positive biopsies of Gleason 6 cancer, as long as there is not too much cancer in the positive biopsy core(s). Since these cancers are small and slow growing, it is believed that these men are generally at low risk for spread of cancer while un&shy;der active surveillance. Men may choose active surveillance as opposed to treatment in order to avoid the inconvenienc&shy;es and potential side effects of treatment. </font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If a man decides not to pursue immediate treatment, a critical element of active surveillance for healthy men with very low-risk prostate cancer is appropriate long-term follow-up, particularly follow-up prostate biopsies. Relying on follow-up PSAs alone (without biopsies) is not enough. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If you pursue a course of active surveillance, your urologist will advise you as to the timing of follow-up PSA testing and prostate biopsies. About 25% of healthy men with very low risk prostate cancer who qualify for and pursue active surveillance will eventually require treatment due to cancer growth, as determined by their follow up PSA and prostate biopsy results. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">There are many factors to consider when deciding which treatment to choose for your prostate cancer. These decisions should be made in conjunction with your doctors, which include urologists and radiation oncologists, and you may wish to talk with your primary care physician, family, and friends as well.</font></p>

96,A Call to Tristate Men – Join Movember 2017 ,November 1 marks the start of Movember. Will you be joining the cause?,"<p>
	Tomorrow begins our annual Movember campaign to raise awareness for men&rsquo;s health issues. Locally we are calling it &quot;Grow and Give.&quot; It&rsquo;s a month when men around the world put down their razors to spark conversations about important health topics like prostate cancer. Our offices are also collecting donations for <a href=""http://zerocancer.org"" target=""_blank"">ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer</a>. <img alt="""" src=""/Media/979/Grow_and_Give_Logo.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 134px; float: right;"" /></p>
<p>
	Over the past 35 years we have witnessed great progress around increasing breast cancer awareness. As physicians, we are nothing short of pleased with the results. Years of campaigning and promotion have led to lower rates of breast cancer through early detection. We hope someday to make the same strides with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>
	Movember is about changing mindsets more than appearances.</p>
<p>
	Prostate cancer is highly curable if caught early. Unfortunately, many men are still afraid or embarrassed to get an annual exam. But, talk to any man who has had one and he will tell you that it really wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. All that&rsquo;s involved is a simple blood test to check your PSA (prostate-specific antigen) level and a digital rectal exam to check the size of your prostate. That part is painless and only takes about 15 seconds, despite what many men fear.</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re over 50 and haven&rsquo;t had a prostate exam, the best way you can participate in Movember is to schedule one. You can make an appointment with one of our physicians or attend a free health screening that we are co-sponsoring this Friday. Here are the details:</p>

	If you&rsquo;ve had your prostate checked, join Movember by letting your facial hair grow--or your head of hair if you&#39;re already bearded-up! Friends and family may wonder about the sudden appearance of all that extra hair but you can use it as a springboard to talk about prostate cancer and help change the face of men&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;</p>

97,Feast Sensibly: Advice for a Healthier Thanksgiving ,How to eat sensibly and survive the holidays a little healthier.,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Thanksgiving is upon us, and with that comes a large table piled-high with delicious, savory dishes&mdash;many that might not make the top list of &ldquo;superfoods.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Physicians have varying opinions on how certain foods may or may not promote good health. For example, many agree that certain berries, especially cranberries, can help prevent UTIs and some bladder infections. That&rsquo;s because they contain a substance called flavonols, which may prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of the bladder. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">So, does that mean piling high the cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving Day? Probably not, as the sugar in most recipes offsets any value the berries may offer. Similarly, you may think whole grain rolls instead of traditional sweet rolls are a healthy choice. They are, until you layer on the butter or cream. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">My general advice about Thanksgiving: follow a normal first-half-of-the-day routine, exercise portion control and stay hydrated. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -0.25in;"">
	<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""margin: 0px;""><font size=""3"">&middot;</font><span style=""font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; margin: 0px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Treat the first part of your day like any other, eating a balanced breakfast and light lunch. Forgoing your early meals and saving up your calories so you can eat a big dinner just may backfire on you. If you go into Thanksgiving extra hungry you&rsquo;re more likely to overeat. Follow your normal workout routine or, if time doesn&rsquo;t permit, at least squeeze in a short walk before dinner. You will go into dinner feeling energized and in a healthier mindset, helping you stay more conscious of making good choices when it comes to portion sizes. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -0.25in;"">
	<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""margin: 0px;""><font size=""3"">&middot;</font><span style=""font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; margin: 0px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">It&rsquo;s tempting to want to try all the foods being served. After all, how often do you get to eat Aunt Mary&rsquo;s pecan pie? Instead of piling on full servings of everything, try one tablespoon of each item. You will be amazed how quickly these tablespoons add up and fill a plate. Then, if you&rsquo;re still craving seconds you&rsquo;ll be better able to choose the one or two items you like best. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px 48px; text-indent: -0.25in;"">
	<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""margin: 0px;""><font size=""3"">&middot;</font><span style=""font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; margin: 0px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Stay hydrated. Water is a good idea any day of the year; however, it can be especially important around the holidays. It helps our bodies function at their best and can help compensate for high-salt meals. Filling up on water also helps curb your appetite. Try alternating between water and whatever your favorite Thanksgiving drink is, especially if it contains alcohol or sugar. 8 x 8 is an easy rule to remember about how much you should drink a day: eight 8-oz glasses of water a day. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Thanksgiving is a day where most of us will stray a little from our good health practices&mdash;and that&rsquo;s okay. Keep this advice in mind, and it might just make getting back into a healthy routine on Black Friday a little easier. </font></p>

It&rsquo;s painless and the exam takes less time than standing in line for a refill. Truly. This simple exam helps set a baseline for monitoring your health as you age, providing you with more time and more options to address the disease if you get it.</p>

		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; Without a doubt, exercise is critical for health living. It not only improves your body but your mind and stress level as well. The CDC developed a 30/60/90-minute exercise guideline:<br />

	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Stop smoking</strong> &ndash; This is a tough one, especially for life-long smokers; however, it is never too late to stop and see some benefits. The amount of carbon monoxide in the blood begins to reduce within a just few hours of quitting. Within a few weeks blood circulation can improve and coughing tends to lessen. For more information on quitting smoking click here: <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/cessation-fact-sheet#q7"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/cessation-fact-sheet#q7</a></font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 10.66px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Get regular checkups</strong> &ndash; It may seem logical that following the previous four steps would eliminate the need for check-ups. However, as mentioned earlier, some diseases simply can&rsquo;t be prevented. Knowing you have a disease early often means more options for fighting it. One regular check-up for every man over 50 should be his annual prostate exam. It&rsquo;s quick and painless and can make a difference in the tools and time you have to fight prostate cancer if diagnosed. </font></li>

101,Farewell to 2017 – An Eventful Year for Our Group,"We are grateful for our physicians, staff and patients for making 2017 an outstanding year for promoting good health in the Tristate.","<p>
	It has been an eventful year for The Urology Group. As the year comes to an end, we want to thank our physicians, staff and patients for the role each played in making 2017 an outstanding year for promoting good health in the Tristate.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		2017 marked significant progress in our fight with prostate cancer. By January we had treated our 1,000th with CyberKnife&reg; SBRT, a non-invasive radiation treatment that is unique to our Group in this region. By year&rsquo;s end that number will likely exceed 1,250.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/713/Walzweb.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 200px; float: right;"" /></li>
	<li>
		We improved our administrative services by introducing a new phone system and a more automated billing system. As with any new systems, there were a few bumps in the road, but our staff rose to the challenge and is now preparing to roll out a new health information system in January. Both systems are designed to serve our patients better.</li>
	<li>
		This year brought accolades for many of our physicians. Dr. Brooke Edwards was named chief medical officer where she provides medical oversight, expertise and leadership to our Group. We honored Dr. Inayat Malik as our &ldquo;Physician Citizen of the Year&rdquo; for his work with the local Muslim community to promote interfaith cooperation. Venue Magazine recognized several of our physicians and staff as &ldquo;Rising Stars&rdquo; in local healthcare:&nbsp; Dr. Aaron Bey, Dr. Michael Dusing, Dr. Brooke Edwards, Dr. Matthew Fulton, Dr. Daniel Robertshaw, Dr. Rebecca Roedersheimer and Dr. Patrick Wirtz.</li>
	<li>
		As a group we were named to the Ohio Business Magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Workplaces in Ohio&rdquo; list, selected as a finalist for the Cincinnati Business Courier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Healthiest Employer&rdquo; award and chosen as a &ldquo;Top Workplace&rdquo; by the Cincinnati Enquirer.</li>
	<li>
		In August we welcomed our newest physician, Dr. Stephen Kappa, who came to us from Nashville. He earned his undergraduate degree in Political Science from Yale University as well as an MBA from Vanderbilt University and completed his residency in urology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We look forward to continuing to provide the most cutting-edge treatment to improve the lives of our patients. We wish everyone a happy and healthy New Year.</p>

102,Post-holiday Stress and Your Bladder,"Holidays can be stressful and can contribute to health problems, including some urinary issues.","<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Many of us have just finished one of the most stressful times of the year. Although holidays are meant to bring feelings of joy and happiness, they can also produce emotional stress. Pressures from extended family, countless events to attend and an eating schedule that&rsquo;s way out of the norm are all contributors. However, the stress is not limited to its emotional effects. Stress can contribute to some urinary problems.<img alt="""" src=""/Media/38/Roedersheimer.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 184px; float: right;"" /></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Over imbibing in alcohol, caffeine and carbonated beverages at holiday parties can increase symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge incontinence. As both a stimulant and a diuretic, caffeine helps rid your body of fluids. It only makes sense that consuming excessive caffeine means you&rsquo;ll likely urinate more often. Alcohol, on the other hand, can have a longer-term and more serious effect on your urinary system. Not only does alcohol interfere with the proper absorption of vitamins and minerals, it can damage your kidneys. Put the two together and the situation worsens for those with a serious alcohol problem. Caffeine can exacerbate the negative side effects of drinking by impairing the kidneys&rsquo; ability to filter waste.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">People with overactive bladder&mdash;and even those without it&mdash;may find themselves going to the bathroom more frequently when they are nervous. Even if they can&rsquo;t go, they may experience a sensation of urgency to go. Many physicians believe this is often a result of nerves that prevent a person from relaxing his or her pelvic floor muscles enough to completely empty the bladder. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Patients with interstitial cystitis may notice more frequent flare ups in their symptoms during times of emotional stress. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a long-term inflammation of the bladder wall, also called painful bladder syndrome. Its symptoms are very similar to a urinary tract infection, such as urinary urgency and/or pelvic pain, but lack an identifiable cause such as bacterial infection. Nearly 12% of women experience IC, which is ten times more often than men.</font></p>

Eat a sensible diet. Drink plenty of water. Find ways to exercise, even when the weather outside isn&rsquo;t cooperating. And, get plenty of rest. Returning to a normal routine can help your body, as much as your mind get ready for a New Year.</span></font></p>

103,"Eat, Play, Move: 3 Small Ways to Maintain a Healthy Weight","If I wanted to live large, I would have to start thinking small. ","<p style=""text-align: right;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><em><img alt="""" src=""/Media/820/image001.png"" style=""width: 175px; height: 175px; float: left;"" />Living healthy, which means maintaining your weight, can inspire big top-of-the-year resolutions. But keeping up with this lifestyle comes down to a bunch of small choices. I&rsquo;ve found most of these decisions can be grouped into three areas.</em><br />
	-&nbsp;Dr. Ryan Flynn</font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">It came down to this: If I wanted to live large, I would have to start thinking small. Large as in healthy, active and happy in my own skin. Small, as in my infant daughter, who five years ago made me see life as a gift.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">So I made a resolution. I lost 20 burdensome pounds, but more importantly I kept them off. Not through a low-carb diet or gym class or appetite suppressant, but through a few relatively simple, affordable tactics.</font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">In my journey I learned that maintaining a healthy weight is a lifestyle change that comes down to many small choices. National Healthy Weight Week (Jan. 20-26) reminded me of the simplicity of these choices year-round, so I&rsquo;m sharing them. And to make it even simpler, I grouped them into three categories.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Ask: You sure you&rsquo;re still hungry? </strong>The long-living Okinawans of Japan have a rule: Eat until you&rsquo;re 80% full. But how do you know? I track it by putting less on my plate (a smaller plate will help). When I do load up, it&rsquo;s on vegetables, which are filling and good for digestion. My plate looks like a smiling face: The bottom half is veggies and the top is evenly divided between protein and carbs. If you choose seconds, choose veggies.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Step, squat, just get physical.</strong> Find your starting point for physical activity and turn up the heat by 20%. What you do isn&rsquo;t important as long as it makes you feel better. If it&rsquo;s practicing your dance moves in front of the mirror, have at it. I started with body weight exercises &ndash; 20 push-ups and 20 squats as a daily minimum, but I often found myself choosing to do more. Now I put in 20 to 30 minutes a day, but build in activities like standing instead of sitting, walking faster and taking the stairs.</font></font></font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Pause before you bite (or sip).</strong> Generally, we consumer a lot of unintended calories, from the mayo on our bread to the after-work cocktail. In between we may choose a whipped coffee drink and a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; but sugary granola snack. Like interest on a credit card, sugar calories can have a compounded effect &ndash; a potentially slowed metabolism. So be sure: Is that snack the best choice for your body&rsquo;s needs? When in doubt, choose veggies or fruit.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

104,National Kidney Month and Cancer: How to Protect a Hard-Fighting Organ  ,"Kidneys are among our hardest-working organs, which puts them at higher risk of disease, including cancer. This National Kidney Month, here’s what you should know.","<div>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">There&rsquo;s a reason we got a second helping of kidneys. This month, is a great time to learn why.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Our kidneys, located at either side of the backbone above the waist, are literally in charge of our lifeblood. They filter waste from our blood, regulate blood pressure, balance body fluids and form urine. That&rsquo;s a short list. </font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">However, due to these double-duty functions, not to mention the exposure to toxins, our kidneys are susceptible to many health problems, including cancer. More than 63,000 people are expected to develop kidney cancer in 2018, according to the American Cancer Society.&nbsp; That&#39;s about a one in 48 chance of developing the disease for each of us. </font></div>

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Regardless of where in the body, cancer begins when cells start to grow out of control, forming tumors. When this occurs in the kidneys, it most often develops in the tiny filters used to remove waste from our blood. </font></div>

110,Rising Temperatures Raise Incidents of UTIs – Here’s Why,"In the summer, chances of UTIs escalate for several reasons. Knowing the causes can help prevent the burning and other discomfort most commonly associated with them.","<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">What do swim suits, ice cream cones and bacteria have in common? <img alt="""" src=""/Media/46/Zipkin.png"" style=""float: right;"" /></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Yes, summer. And while it&rsquo;s not a pretty picture, knowing about it can help prevent a lot of discomfort or worse as August rolls around. Urinary tract infections, which occur when bacteria grow in the urine, are shown to be more common in the summer, particularly among younger women. </font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A urinary tract infection (UTI) can occur in either the upper or lower urinary tract and therefore can exist in the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. They are common &ndash; second only to respiratory infections &ndash; <a href=""http://urologygroup.com/conditions-we-treat/urinary-tract-infection/"" target=""_blank"">affecting about 40 percent of women and 12 percent of men</a> at some point in their lives. </font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">And in the summer, those chances escalate for several reasons. Knowing the causes will help prevent the burning and other discomfort most commonly associated with UTIs. </font></p>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Summertime Ex-Tract: 4 Preventions</font></strong><br />
	<p>
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">A UTI typically begins at the opening of the urethra, the tube urine passes through to exit the body from the bladder. The urethra is shorter in women than men, making it easier for bacteria to get to the bladder. But how do the bacteria get in the urethra? One common cause is e. Coli, but in the summer, multiple other factors increase the chances. </font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Changes in urination. </strong>Dehydration is more common in the summer, and it may increase the risk for UTIs as water helps clear the urinary tract of bacteria. Holding it in is also considered a contributing factor. If you begin to feel like you cannot hold your urine, or need to go more frequently yet little comes out, you may be experiencing common UTI symptoms. </font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Rising temperature. </strong>While you&rsquo;re lounging by the pool, keep in mind that bacteria also love to lounge about in heat and humidity. Summer provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria in the urinary tract. Fever, chills and lower abdominal pain are common signs. </font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Wet suits.</strong> Wearing a wet swimsuit all day contributes to the warm, humid environment breeding bacteria love. It&rsquo;s best to switch into dry shorts or a skirt during prolonged pool breaks. Cloudy or bad-smelling urine are warnings of a UTI. </font></li>
		<li>
			<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Sexual activity.</strong> Summer love may contribute to UTIs because the urethra might come into contact with bacteria from the partner&rsquo;s genital area. Cleaning before and after sex, as well as urinating immediately before and after, reduces your chances. Common symptoms of upper urinary tract infections, which affect the kidneys, include nausea, high fever and waist-level pain in the back or side. </font>
			<p>
				<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Whether you are a man or woman, if you experience any of these signs, or see blood in your urine, call a urologist. </font></p>
			<strong><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Easy-Peesy Test</font></strong><br />
			<p>
				<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Identifying a UTI is a pretty quick-and-easy process. Often, a urine sample is applied to a chemical stick and examined for bacteria. </font></p>
			<p>
				<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Patients with recurring UTIs may require internal imaging to detect underlying problems in the urinary tract. These tests can range from a cystoscopy, when a tiny camera is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, to various forms of X-ray imaging, including ultrasounds and CT scans. </font></p>
			<p>
				<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Treatment usually involves antibiotics, though in more severe cases hospitalization and IV antibiotics may be necessary. Pregnancy, kidney stones and compromised immune systems may contribute to such advanced treatments. </font></p>
			<p>
				<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">In each case, plenty of sunshine also should help, because it does tend to lift spirits. Just be sure to keep that swim suit dry whenever possible! </font></p>

<p>
	But, two decades ago when robotics made its debut in the OR, the decision on whether to use it depended heavily on a variety of factors. Limitations on a person&rsquo;s weight or other health-related conditions often eliminated a patient from eligibility. Additionally, robotics was limited to just a few conditions and relied on physicians&rsquo; training and familiarity with the new tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Today, however, robotics is more the norm than the exception for many conditions&mdash;or it&rsquo;s at least a more regular option on the operating table than in the past.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Common robotic surgeries</strong></p>
<p>
	In urology, depending on the patient&rsquo;s specific case, robotics can be used for a wide variety of conditions, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Prostate Cancer &ndash; to perform a prostatectomy to remove the prostate</li>
	<li>
		Kidney Disorder or Cancer &ndash; to perform a complete or partial nephrectomy (removal of the kidney)</li>
	<li>
		Bladder Cancer &ndash; to perform a cystectomy, which is the surgical removal of all or part of the urinary bladder</li>
	<li>
		Urinary Blockage &ndash; to perform a pyeloplasty to remove the blockage and reattach the healthy part of the kidney to the healthy part of the ureter</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Benefits of today&rsquo;s robotics</strong></p>
<p>
	Most patients continue to see the initial benefits robotics surgery promised: faster recovery, fewer complications and shorter hospital stays.<a href=""http://theurologygroup.dev.websprockets.com/services-we-offer/robotic/"" target=""_self""><img alt="""" src=""/Media/711/Robotics Icon.png"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); border-image: none; width: 234px; height: 234px; text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: 13.06px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; cursor: default; orphans: 2; float: right; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: transparent;"" /></a></p>
<p>
	Due to improvements and advancements, today&rsquo;s robotics offer even more benefits. More obese patients now qualify as candidates. Precision has increased even further. And, more healthcare providers are offering robotics as an option.</p>
<p>
	The Urology Group has used robotics for nearly as long as our group has existed, and our staff of robotic surgeons has significantly increased over the past several years. We look forward to continuing to grow our expertise as the market introduces the next wave of robotic tools that are even more nimble and capable of performing even more complex procedures.</p>

	<p>
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">In March, the media often makes a connection between March Madness and vasectomies. Why? Well, men who are considering a vasectomy often schedule it around the tournament so that they have a built-in excuse to stay home and watch.

	<p>
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">One important reminder to all men is to schedule a follow-up visit with your urologist a few weeks after the procedure to ensure it was successful. While vasectomies are highly effective, you should use birth control until your physician determines you are completely sterile.&nbsp;</font></p>

	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Though not common &ndash; it develops in just one of every 250 men in their lifetimes, according to the American Cancer Society &ndash; testicular cancer is typically a young man&rsquo;s disease; the average diagnosis age is 33. This makes detection a challenge because those affected are usually in the primes of their lives, not thinking about serious illness.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">

<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Yet checking for this cancer is so easy, and it&rsquo;s so highly treatable when found early. So, there&rsquo;s no excuse not to squeeze in a self-exam once a month.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<br />
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>How to Perform a Self-Exam</strong><br />
	Testicular cancer occurs when the cells in the testes reproduce at an accelerated rate, resulting in a malignant mass.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Though the cause is not clear, several factors can increase the risk. These include a family history of the disease; one or two undescended testicles; and a genetic disorder called Klinefelter syndrome, a condition marked by two or more X chromosomes that results in low testosterone levels and other symptoms.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">If any of these factors apply to you or a loved one, it&rsquo;s time turn on the shower.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The process for detecting testicular cancer is fast and painless, but it should be regular so you can spot the difference between what is normal and not. These monthly self-exams are best performed in a warm shower, where one can comfortably feel for irregularities such as hard lumps or nodules. If any inconsistencies are detected, see your urologist right away.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<br />
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Know the Symptoms</strong><br />
	Even if your self exams check out, be aware of other symptoms of testicular cancer, the most common being pain in one or both testicles, changes in their size or shape and pressure in the lower back, belly and/or groin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the affected area, which the physician will exam to plan post-surgery care. This could range from simple surveillance (if the cancer is found early) to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, the physician may also remove potentially cancerous lymph nodes.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style=""margin: 0px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">The lifetime risk of dying from testicular cancer is just one in 5,000, with odds improving the sooner it is detected. So yes, you may be as likely to get struck by testicular cancer as by lightning, but why risk it? Just as we seek shelter in electrical storms, we can provide coverage against the disease with a five-minute self-exam. If present, it can be treated early.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>

	That&rsquo;s the average number of times we urinate every 24 hours, marking the bladder&rsquo;s capacity to hold liquids at about 20 ounces, or the size of a Starbucks venti coffee. So, if you notice it&rsquo;s hauling less water with each bathroom visit, it could be time to see a doctor.</p>
<p>
	In fact, you should try to pay special attention to the job your bladder is doing all month long. May is Bladder Cancer Awareness month, highlighting the fourth most-common cancer in men. Each year, about 62,380 cases of bladder cancer are reported in men, and 18,810 in women, according to the American Cancer Society.</p>
<p>
	Fortunately, the survival rate is good &ndash; 77% in the first five years &ndash; but it has to be detected. Here are four ways you can detect a bladder issue, but first, a bladder introduction.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Works Like a Smart Balloon</strong></h3>
<p>
	You can say the bladder operates a little like the bagpipes &ndash; a lesser-glorified but equally complex instrument.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s a hollow organ, located in the pelvis, that stores urine delivered from the kidneys above. It does this like a programmed balloon, retaining urine within the lines of stretchable muscle that expand until it reaches capacity.</p>
<p>
	When we urinate, the bladder muscles squeeze and cause its valves to open so the urine can escape through the urethra. That&rsquo;s when we should feel welcomed relief &ndash; unless there is pain or trouble going in the first place.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>What to Look For: 4 Signs</strong></h3>
<p>
	Those who smoke are at higher risk of getting bladder cancer; however, anyone is susceptible to it.</p>
<p>
	Detecting bladder cancer can be quite simple. The key is to not ignore the symptoms. The most common signal that you should call your physician is if you see blood in your urine, even if you have no other symptoms. Asymptomatic hematuria, as it&#39;s called, is the number one indicator of bladder cancer, although many people discount this symptom as the result of a urinary infection.</p>
<p>
	Other symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Trouble urinating</li>
	<li>
		Pain when urinating</li>
	<li>
		The need to pee more often than usual</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you detect any of these symptoms, even if you do not see blood, call your urologist for a screening. There may be traces of microscopic blood that can only be detected in a sample.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>What to Expect</strong></h3>
<p>
	If your doctor suspects bladder cancer, it will be diagnosed by a procedure called a cystoscopy, in which a threadlike scope is inserted through the urethra to view the bladder.</p>
<p>
	Often, the physician can biopsy and remove the growth during a cystoscopy. If not, medicine can be administered through a catheter, a procedure called intravesical therapy. If the cancer is in later stages, surgery may be required to remove part or all of the bladder, as well as potentially the prostate and lymph nodes.</p>
<p>
	The bladder may not be the most lionized organ, but it is as important to a healthy-functioning body as the others. This month, pay attention to how it&rsquo;s working for you.</p>

85,Planting Hope with Penile Implants,Nationally acclaimed physician visits with Dr. Campbell,"<p>
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Last week I had the professional privilege of spending several days with Dr. Steven K. Wilson, a world renowned leading innovator in prosthetic urology of <a href=""http://www.ranchomirageurology.com/steven-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Valley Urologic Medical Group</a> </font><font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">in California. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Dr. Wilson was passing through Ohio after working with residents from Northwestern University &amp; the University of Chicago,&nbsp;lecturing to the staff physicians and residents and performing surgery at Northwestern and the Jesse Brown VA Hospitals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""/Media/904/Drs_Campbell_Wilson_shaking_hands.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 309px; float: right;"" /></font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">On his visit to Cincinnati he accompanied me in the OR for two surgeries to implant penile prostheses. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Dr. Wilson has completed more than 11,000 such implants and has performed prosthetic surgery in nearly 50 countries in his 40 years of practice. If there is a &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; in the field of prosthetic urology, Dr. Wilson would take center stage. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">Prosthetic urology is not new; however, since most of the advancements are not typical dinner table conversation, many patients are not aware of options they may have. </font></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">For example, some men who experience chronic erectile dysfunction may benefit from a penile implant. There are two typical types of implants, either malleable or inflatable. </font></p>
<ul>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Malleable implant </strong>&ndash; Surgically installed, this implant consists of two malleable (or bendable) rods. With it, a man merely lifts or adjusts the penis into the erect position to initiate sex. While it is the simplest implant, it does mean the penis is always semi-rigid, which some men don&rsquo;t prefer. </font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>Inflatable implant </strong>&ndash; This medical device is custom-fit and surgically placed into a penis to produce a natural-looking and natural-feeling erection. In fact, the inflatable prosthesis is not noticeable so your partner won&rsquo;t be able to tell you&rsquo;ve had an implant unless you tell them. </font></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 11px;"">
	<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3"">There are many treatments for men with ED or other sexual performance issues. Finding the right one means first discussing the topic with your urologist.&nbsp;</font></p>

Half of all men by the age of 60 and as many as 90 percent in their 80s experience signs of BPH. But its prevalence doesn&rsquo;t diminish its effects on lifestyle, which at the minimum cause discomfort. At its worse, an enlarged prostate could contribute to other conditions including bladder infections. </span></span></span></font></p>

		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>It grows, and grows, on you. </strong>The prostate gland, located in the reproductive system below the bladder and surrounding the urethra, goes through two growth periods. The first is in early puberty and the second starts at around age 25 &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t stop. As it enlarges, the gland becomes restricted by the tissue surrounding it, causing it to press against the urethra.&nbsp;</span></font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>It tends to stall things.</strong> The most common symptoms of enlarged prostate involve changes and problems with urination. These include higher frequency of urination (especially at night), difficulty starting to pee and an interrupted or weak stream, leakage and an inability to completely empty the bladder. A less common symptom is blood in the urine.&nbsp;</span></span></font></li>
	<li style=""margin: 0px;"">
		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>It&rsquo;s manliness is unclear.</strong> The male hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may contribute to an enlarged prostate, in that DHT promotes the growth of prostate cells and some experts believe DHT levels rise as men age. However, these causes are still being examined. Also, increased levels of the female hormone estrogen, in men called estradiol, can cause an enlarged prostate. </span></span></span></font></li>

However, there are other common procedures. The urine flow test, for example, just requires peeing into a special device that measures the strength and volume of the flow.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></font></li>

		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>It can be infectious, and rocky.</strong> An enlarged prostate may cause urinary tract infections, so a physician is likely to prescribe antibiotics to clear it up before beginning any treatments. Symptoms also could progress into bladder stones &ndash; so don&rsquo;t put it off!&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></font></li>

In a HoLEP (holmium laser enucleation of the prostate), a laser removes the portion of the prostate gland obstructing urine flow. Or the doctor can perform a transurethral vaporization, through which an electrode is passed through the urethra and eliminates the tissue.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></font></li>

		<font face=""Calibri"" size=""3""><strong>The myth &ndash; Size matters.</strong> No, it doesn&rsquo;t! This is the biggest myth about an enlarged prostate. Big symptoms may indicate a small enlargement, and vice versa. The severity of the signs simply do not always correlate with size.<br />
		Also, while the symptoms suggest an enlarged prostate, they also might indicate other conditions that require further examination. Signs of an enlarged prostate, for example, can be similar to those of prostate cancer.
