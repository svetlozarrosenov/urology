	<strong>Improving Lives Campaign Features Series of Free Prostate Cancer Screenings for Tri-State Men in 2012</strong></p>
<p>
	<em>The Urology Group Offers First Free Screenings April 2 in Sharonville</em></p>
<p>
	CINCINNATI (March 21, 2012) &ndash; The Urology Group will provide a series of free prostate screenings under a community outreach program dedicated to fighting prostate cancer. The goal of the campaign is to increase the percentage of local men getting tested and raise awareness about the benefit of early detection throughout the tri-state.</p>
<p>
	The Cincinnati area&rsquo;s largest urological practice will conduct the first free screenings for men on April 2 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Sharonville Convention Center, 11355 Chester Road. The screenings coincide with the Baby Boomer/Senior Expo. The second free-screening event will be part of the Santa Maria Community Health Fair on April 15 from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. The location is the Price Hill Recreation Center, 959 Hawthorne Ave.</p>
<p>
	The privately conducted screenings are a painless 5-10 minute process consisting of a simple blood test and a brief prostate exam. Health insurance is not required.</p>
<p>
	The Urology Group&rsquo;s campaign will also feature a 5K Run/Walk for Prostate Cancer on Saturday, September 8, in Norwood. Community groups or other large organizations interested in partnering with The Urology Group on a free-screening event or to sponsor the 5K may email <a href=""mailto:Prostate5KCincy@Theurologygroup.net"">Prostate5KCincy@Theurologygroup.net</a>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Early detection is critical to successfully treating prostate cancer. Urologists have seen a nearly 40% reduction in prostate cancer deaths since the mid-1990s when testing became commonplace for men over 50 and for higher risk men over 40,&rdquo; said Dr. Gary M. Kirsh, President of The Urology Group. &ldquo;The cure rate is extremely high when prostate cancer is detected early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	According to the American Cancer Society about 1 man in 6 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime and more than 28,000 will die from the disease each year. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind only lung cancer.</p>
<p>
	More information about the free prostate cancer screening campaign, including times and locations of additional screening events throughout the year, will be posted on <a href=""http://www.freeprostatecincy.com/"">www.freeprostatecincy.com</a>.</p>
